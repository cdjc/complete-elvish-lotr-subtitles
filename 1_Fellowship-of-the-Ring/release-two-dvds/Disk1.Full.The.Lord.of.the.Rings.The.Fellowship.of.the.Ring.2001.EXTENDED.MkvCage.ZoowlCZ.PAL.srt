10
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:36,755
I feel it in the water.

[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>

12

[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned 'wilith.</i>

14
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:46,074
I smell it in the air.

15
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,280
Much that once was...

16
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,006
...is lost.

17
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:53,554
For none now live who remember it.

18
00:00:53,554 --> 00:01:00,748
The Lord of the Rings.

19
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:10,051
It began with the forging of the great rings.

20
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,161
Three were given to the elves:

21
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:15,901
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,545
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

23
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:23,862
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

24
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:25,588
And nine...

25
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,561
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

26
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:32,493
...who, above all else, desire power.

27
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:38,440
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

28
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,043
But they were all of them deceived.

29
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:45,345
For another ring was made.

30
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,469
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

31
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:54,169
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

32
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:56,375
... to control all others.

33
00:01:56,662 --> 00:02:00,307
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,526
...and his will to dominate all life.

35
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:09,226
One ring to rule them all.

36
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,720
One by one...

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,228
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

38
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:19,392
But there were some who resisted.

39
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:24,284
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

40
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:28,983
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

51
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,442
But the power of the ring...

52
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,456
...could not be undone.

56
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,488
It was in this moment...

57
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,982
... when all hope had faded...

58
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,010
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

59
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:16,976
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

60
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,895
The ring passed to Isildur...

61
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,019
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

62
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,800
But the hearts of men...

63
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,389
...are easily corrupted.

64
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,994
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

65
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,752
It betrayed Isildur...

66
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,876
... to his death.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,548
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

68
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:20,946
...were lost.

69
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,919
History became legend...

70
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:26,029
...legend became myth.

71
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:28,907
And for two and a half thousand years...

72
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,743
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

73
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,004
Until, when chance came...

74
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,648
...it ensnared a new bearer.

75
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:45,498
My precious.

76
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,279
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

77
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:52,115
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

78
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:55,281
And there it consumed him.

79
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,391
It came to me.

80
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:01,803
My own. My love. My own.

81
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:06,502
My precious.

82
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:13,311
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

83
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:17,147
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

84
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:21,656
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

85
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,108
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

86
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:28,081
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

87
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,959
... whispers of a nameless fear.

88
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,315
And the ring of power perceived...

89
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,192
...its time had now come.

90
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,083
It abandoned Gollum.

91
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:46,880
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

92
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:52,154
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

93
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,497
What's this?

94
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,127
A hobbit.

95
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,813
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

96
00:06:58,196 --> 00:06:59,827
A ring.

97
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,745
Lost!

98
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:05,964
The 22nd day of September...

99
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,596
My precious is lost!

100
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,089
For the time will soon come...

101
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:15,172
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

102
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:26,009
...in the year 1400...

103
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:28,503
...by Shire-reckoning.

104
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:34,066
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

105
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,272
...the Shire...

106
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,149
...Middle-earth.

107
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:46,726
The third age of this world.

108
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:53,823
The Fellowship of the Ring.

109
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,441
There and back again.

110
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,989
A Hobbit's tale.

111
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:07,921
By Bilbo Baggins.

112
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,155
Now...

113
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,840
...where to begin?

114
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:19,142
Ah, yes....

115
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,185
"Concerning...

116
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,775
...Hobbits."

117
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,186
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

118
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:34,392
...for many hundreds of years...

119
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:37,557
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

120
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:40,530
...by the world of the big folk.

121
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:46,189
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

122
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:49,546
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

123
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,478
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

124
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:57,698
...nor counted among the very wise.

125
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,794
Frodo! Someone at the door.

126
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,439
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

127
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:12,755
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

128
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:15,345
A rather unfair observation...

129
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,893
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

130
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:22,058
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

131
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,223
But where our hearts truly lie...

132
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,429
...is in peace and quiet...

133
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,210
...and good, tilled earth.

134
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:35,294
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

135
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,487
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

136
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,665
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

137
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:53,899
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

138
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:01,093
Frodo, the door!

139
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,655
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

140
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,478
Frodo!

141
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,301
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

142
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:25,550
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

143
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,537
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

144
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,893
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

145
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:38,880
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

146
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,196
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

147
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:50,006
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

148
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:55,185
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

149
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,995
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

150
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:16,285
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

151
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,025
How is the old rascal?

152
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,957
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

153
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,451
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

154
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:28,560
Well, that should please him.

155
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,479
Half the Shire's been invited.

156
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,260
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

157
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,399
And so life in the Shire goes on...

158
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,563
... very much as it has this past age.

159
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,934
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

160
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,044
If it comes at all.

161
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:54,551
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

162
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,004
...passing from one generation to the next.

163
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:03,184
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

164
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,814
...in Bag End.

165
00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:10,089
And there always will be.

166
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,925
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

167
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,378
I mean, more than usual.

168
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,159
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

169
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,625
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

170
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:39,532
Where's it gone?

171
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:07,154
He's up to something.

172
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:17,320
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

173
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,143
But I know you have something to do with it.

174
00:13:19,526 --> 00:13:20,485
Good gracious me.

175
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,458
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

176
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:24,609
Indeed.

177
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:27,007
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

178
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:33,049
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

179
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:36,789
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

180
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:40,913
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

181
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,216
Oh, really?

182
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:50,504
Gandalf! Gandalf!

183
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,601
Fireworks, Gandalf!

184
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,972
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

185
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,154
Gandalf?

186
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,469
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

187
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,608
So am I.

188
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,545
No, thank you!

189
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:08,285
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

190
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,930
And what about very old friends?

191
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,725
Gandalf?

192
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,562
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

193
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:25,645
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

194
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,385
You haven't aged a day.

195
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,633
Come on, come in!

196
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,126
Welcome, welcome.

197
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,675
Oh, here we are.

198
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,704
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

199
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:51,444
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

200
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:55,376
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

201
00:15:56,719 --> 00:16:00,843
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

202
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,624
Just tea, thank you.

203
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,393
I was expecting you sometime last week.

204
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,750
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

205
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:19,833
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

206
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:23,285
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

207
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,313
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

208
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,821
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

209
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:34,699
I've just found some sponge cake.

210
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:38,823
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

211
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,056
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

212
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,221
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

213
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,194
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

214
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:52,921
I'm not at home!

215
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:01,169
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

216
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,375
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

217
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,348
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

218
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:09,225
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

219
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:11,239
...never giving me a moment's peace.

220
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:15,363
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

221
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:19,871
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

222
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,804
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

223
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,201
All the arrangements are made.

224
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,654
Oh, thank you.

225
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,339
Frodo suspects something.

226
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,928
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

227
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:37,614
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

228
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,875
You will tell him, won't you?

229
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,656
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

230
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,300
I know.

231
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,768
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

232
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,508
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

233
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:00,344
The woods, the fields.

234
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,742
Little rivers.

235
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,647
I am old, Gandalf.

236
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:15,881
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

237
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:20,581
I feel thin.

238
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:22,403
Sort of stretched...

239
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,719
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

240
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:31,226
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

241
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:34,487
And I don't expect I shall return.

242
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,763
In fact, I mean not to.

243
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:46,092
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

244
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,370
Gandalf, my old friend...

245
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,151
...this will be a night to remember.

246
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,169
Hello, hello.

247
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:35,197
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

248
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,650
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

249
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,500
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

250
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,377
Go on!

251
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,790
So there I was...

252
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,914
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

253
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,024
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

254
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,422
...about how they were going to cook us.

255
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:12,409
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

256
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,821
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

257
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,466
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

258
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,822
...and turned them all to stone!

259
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,344
Quickly.

260
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,290
Up they go!

261
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,318
No no, the big one - big one

262
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,731
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

263
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,745
Are all these children yours?

264
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:56,718
Good gracious, you have been productive.

265
00:20:58,732 --> 00:20:59,979
Bilbo?

266
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,240
Sackville-Bagginses!

267
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,487
Quickly, hide!

268
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:16,092
Thank you, my boy.

269
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,736
You're a good lad, Frodo.

270
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,668
I'm very selfish, you know.

271
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:27,409
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

272
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,902
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

273
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,533
...but it wasn't out of charity.

274
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,452
I think it was because...

275
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,753
...of all my numerous relations...

276
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,398
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

277
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,507
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

278
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,330
No.

279
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,015
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

280
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:49,372
The point is, Frodo...

281
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,263
...you'll be all right.

282
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,443
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

283
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,169
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

284
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,799
This was your idea.

285
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,487
Bilbo.

286
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,132
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

287
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,584
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

288
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:42,888
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

289
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:48,451
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

290
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,561
I might've known.

291
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:58,234
Speech, Bilbo!

292
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:00,439
Speech!

293
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,590
Speech!

294
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:08,784
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

295
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:11,565
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

296
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:14,155
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

297
00:23:14,442 --> 00:23:15,401
...Hornblowers...

298
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:18,087
...Bolgers...

299
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,005
...Bracegirdles...

300
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,690
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

301
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:27,773
Today is my 111th birthday!

302
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:31,034
Happy birthday!

303
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:35,159
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

304
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:38,228
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

305
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,776
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

306
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:46,284
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

307
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:58,177
I have things to do.

308
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,328
I've put this off for far too long.

309
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,809
I regret to announce this is the end!

310
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,111
I'm going now.

311
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:19,947
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

312
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:23,400
Goodbye.

313
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:58,214
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

314
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,667
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

315
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,640
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

316
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,846
...and none of them should be used lightly.

317
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:08,956
It was just a bit of fun.

318
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:12,697
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

319
00:25:14,136 --> 00:25:17,396
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

320
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,177
As often as I can spare them.

321
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,438
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

322
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:26,795
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

323
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:31,111
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

324
00:25:32,261 --> 00:25:35,043
No. Wait, it's...

325
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,031
...here in my pocket.

326
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,511
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

327
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:52,498
Yet, after all, why not?

328
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:58,540
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

329
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:01,129
Is that so hard?

330
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:02,665
Well, no.

331
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:06,405
And yes.

332
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:11,200
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

333
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,214
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

334
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:17,338
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

335
00:26:17,818 --> 00:26:19,448
It's mine.

336
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,188
My own.

337
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:27,217
- My precious.
- Precious?

338
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:30,190
It's been called that before, but not by you.

339
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:32,876
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

340
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:35,753
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

341
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,630
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

342
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,850
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

343
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:46,590
I am not trying to rob you.

344
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,112
I'm trying to help you.

345
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:04,333
All your long years, we've been friends.

346
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:06,827
Trust me as you once did.

347
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:10,375
Let it go.

348
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:13,732
You're right, Gandalf.

349
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,336
The ring must go to Frodo.

350
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:22,556
It's late. The road is long.

351
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,145
Yes, it is time.

352
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:32,434
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

353
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,784
I've thought up an ending for my book:

354
00:28:10,414 --> 00:28:15,017
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

355
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:18,662
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

356
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:21,059
Goodbye, Gandalf.

357
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:26,142
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

358
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,652
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

359
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:42,543
Until our next meeting.

360
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:12,178
It's mine. My own.

361
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:15,727
My precious.

362
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,700
Riddles in the dark.

363
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:20,427
Bilbo!

364
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,961
Bilbo!

365
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:28,387
My precious.

366
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,935
Precious.

367
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,525
He's gone, hasn't he?

368
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:40,183
He talked for so long about leaving...

369
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,964
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

370
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:49,199
Gandalf?

371
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,694
Bilbo's ring.

372
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,283
He's gone to stay with the elves.

373
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:04,352
He's left you Bag End.

374
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:10,395
Along with all his possessions.

375
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:13,272
The ring is yours now.

376
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:19,122
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

377
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:21,424
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

378
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:25,644
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

379
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:29,096
I don't understand.

380
00:30:32,357 --> 00:30:33,317
Neither do I.

381
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,687
Keep it secret.

382
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,606
Keep it safe.

383
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,187
Shire!

384
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:18,506
Baggins!

385
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:27,850
{\an8} [Adûnaic] ♫ <i>Nêbâbîtham Magânanê.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ We renounce our Creator. ♫

386
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,744
"The year 3434 of the second age.

387
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:13,061
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

388
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:16,897
...and the finding of the ring of power."

389
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,076
"It has come to me.

390
00:32:22,364 --> 00:32:25,528
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

391
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:28,981
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

392
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,817
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

393
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,502
It is precious to me...

394
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:38,860
...though I buy it with great pain.

395
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:45,765
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

396
00:32:46,245 --> 00:32:50,560
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

397
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,684
A secret now that only fire can tell."

398
00:33:10,797 --> 00:33:13,578
Shire...

399
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,592
...Baggins.

400
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:19,908
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

401
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,977
That way.

402
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:28,636
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

403
00:33:28,636 --> 00:33:30,938
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

404
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:33,336
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

405
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:35,349
<i>But there still be...</i>

406
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:36,884
<i>...many miles to go</i>

407
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:38,994
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

408
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:41,200
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

409
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:43,214
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

410
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,707
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

411
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:51,654
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

412
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:55,682
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

413
00:33:56,353 --> 00:33:57,696
War is brewing.

414
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:00,957
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

415
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,834
Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is.

416
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:08,246
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

417
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,123
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

418
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:12,849
And proud of it.

419
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,343
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

420
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:19,180
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

421
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:23,399
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

422
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,866
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

423
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:33,277
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

424
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,771
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

425
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:40,184
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

426
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:42,389
Does she?

427
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:45,842
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

428
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:12,025
Is it secret? Is it safe?

429
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,574
What are you doing?

430
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:37,152
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

431
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,495
It's quite cool.

432
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,482
What can you see?

433
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:47,510
Can you see anything?

434
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,538
Nothing.

435
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:53,937
There's nothing.

436
00:35:55,183 --> 00:35:56,526
Wait.

437
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,568
There are markings.

438
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:07,267
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

439
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,857
There are few who can.

440
00:36:10,528 --> 00:36:14,940
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

441
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:16,762
Mordor!

442
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,873
In the common tongue, it says:

443
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,421
"One ring to rule them all...

444
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,915
...One ring to find them...

445
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,216
...One ring to bring them all...

446
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,381
...and in the darkness bind them."

447
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,930
This is the One ring...

448
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:39,013
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

449
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:43,137
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

450
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:46,398
Bilbo found it.

451
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:48,700
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

452
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:53,207
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

453
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:56,660
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

454
00:36:57,427 --> 00:37:01,455
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

455
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,044
The ring has awoken.

456
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,826
It's heard its master's call.

457
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:10,663
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

458
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,239
No, Frodo.

459
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:22,363
The spirit of Sauron endured.

460
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:27,542
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

461
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:30,035
Sauron has returned.

462
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,914
His orcs have multiplied.

463
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:36,941
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

464
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:41,641
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

465
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,942
He is seeking it.

466
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,683
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

467
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:50,656
For the ring yearns above all else...

468
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:54,108
...to return to the hand of its master.

469
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:56,122
They are one...

470
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:59,096
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

471
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,439
Frodo...

472
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,645
...he must never find it.

473
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:03,892
All right.

474
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:08,303
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

475
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:11,084
No one knows it's here, do they?

476
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:17,702
Do they, Gandalf?

477
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:21,922
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

478
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:25,950
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

479
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,252
But the enemy found him first.

480
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,376
I don't know how long they tortured him.

481
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:36,788
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

482
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,089
Shire!

483
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:40,816
Baggins!

484
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:42,830
Shire.

485
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,611
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

486
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:49,448
Who goes there?

487
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:52,325
Take it, Gandalf!

488
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:53,764
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

489
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,065
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

490
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:59,422
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

491
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:03,066
I dare not take it.

492
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,752
Not even to keep it safe.

493
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:08,820
Understand, Frodo...

494
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:12,849
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

495
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:23,399
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

496
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,947
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

497
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,304
No, it can't.

498
00:39:35,484 --> 00:39:36,826
What must I do?

499
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:41,622
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

500
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:45,074
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

501
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,417
Bree.

502
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:49,198
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

503
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,787
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

504
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:55,528
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

505
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:57,638
I don't have any answers.

506
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:04,256
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

507
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,654
He'll know what to do.

508
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,914
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

509
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:12,600
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

510
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:16,340
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

511
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:20,080
I can cut across country easily enough.

512
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:23,820
My dear Frodo.

513
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,986
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

514
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:29,863
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

515
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:32,357
And yet, after a hundred years...

516
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:34,467
...they can still surprise you.

517
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:37,440
Get down.

518
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,306
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

519
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:54,032
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

520
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,813
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

521
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:59,403
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

522
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,376
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

523
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,622
Nothing important.

524
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:06,500
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

525
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,130
...and something about the end of the world but...

526
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,637
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

527
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,036
No?

528
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:17,338
Perhaps not.

529
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:21,749
I've thought of a better use for you.

530
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:26,257
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

531
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:29,901
Be careful, both of you.

532
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,778
The enemy has many spies in his service:

533
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,751
Birds, beasts.

534
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:39,301
Is it safe?

535
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,178
Never put it on...

536
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,630
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

537
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,261
Always remember, Frodo...

538
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:50,713
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

539
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,207
It wants to be found.

540
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:34,160
This is it.

541
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,557
This is what?

542
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:38,859
If I take one more step...

543
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:42,983
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

544
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:48,641
Come on, Sam.

545
00:42:56,794 --> 00:42:58,520
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

546
00:42:59,096 --> 00:43:02,548
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

547
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:06,960
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

548
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:11,084
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

549
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:24,665

I don't know why...

00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,011
...it makes me sad.

563
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:08,246
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

564
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:10,835
Just shut your eyes...

565
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:13,520
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

566
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:17,548
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

567
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:29,057
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

568
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,935
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

569
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,442
Me neither, Sam.

570
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:06,749
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

571
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,571
The hour grows late.

572
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:12,024
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

573
00:45:12,503 --> 00:45:14,709
...seeking my counsel.

574
00:45:14,997 --> 00:45:18,641
For that is why you have come, is it not?

575
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,080
My old friend.

576
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:21,903
Saruman.

577
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:29,383
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

578
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:32,356
So the ring of power has been found.

579
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:35,521
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

580
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:38,878
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

581
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:43,577
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

582
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,277
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

583
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:50,004
Time?

584
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:53,456
What time do you think we have?

585
00:45:53,936 --> 00:45:57,484
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

586
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,882
He cannot yet take physical form...

587
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:02,663
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

588
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:08,034
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

589
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:14,268
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

590
00:46:15,995 --> 00:46:18,872
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

591
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:24,626
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

592
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:27,407
The eye of Sauron.

593
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:30,093
He is gathering all evil to him.

594
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:32,202
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

595
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,176
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

596
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,766
You know this?

597
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,780
How?

598
00:46:40,355 --> 00:46:41,890
I have seen it.

599
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,342
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

600
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:47,548
Why?

601
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:50,521
Why should we fear to use it?

602
00:46:53,206 --> 00:46:56,851
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

603
00:46:57,138 --> 00:47:00,112
We do not know who else may be watching.

604
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:05,291
The hour is later than you think.

605
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,689
Sauron's forces are already moving.

606
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:12,484
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

607
00:47:12,868 --> 00:47:13,827
The Nine?

608
00:47:13,827 --> 00:47:16,800
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

609
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:19,677
...disguised as riders in black.

610
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:23,609
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

611
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,350
And kill the one who carries it.

612
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,172
Frodo!

613
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:45,476
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

614
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:48,930
There are none who can.

615
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:53,917
Against the power of Mordor...

616
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,698
...there can be no victory.

617
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:01,589
We must join with him, Gandalf.

618
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:05,041
We must join with Sauron.

619
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:10,124
It would be wise, my friend.

620
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:12,138
Tell me...

621
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:13,770
...friend...

622
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:18,469
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

623
00:48:56,544 --> 00:48:58,078
I gave you the chance of...

624
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,723
...aiding me willingly...

625
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,847
...but you have elected the way of pain!

626
00:49:28,386 --> 00:49:29,729
Mr. Frodo?

627
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,030
Frodo? Frodo!

628
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:36,442
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

629
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:39,415
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

630
00:49:40,374 --> 00:49:43,922
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

631
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:47,759
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

632
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:51,595
Frodo.

633
00:49:51,882 --> 00:49:53,993
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

634
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:55,528
Get off him.

635
00:49:56,103 --> 00:49:57,446
Come on, Frodo.

636
00:49:57,446 --> 00:49:59,364
What's the meaning of this?

637
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:02,721
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

638
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,981
You get back here!

639
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,187
Get out of my field!

640
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:10,968
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

641
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:14,037
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

642
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:15,380
And some cabbages.

643
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,354
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

644
00:50:18,354 --> 00:50:22,286
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

645
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,684
...he's clearly overreacting.

646
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:26,314
Run!

647
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,660
Oh, that was close.

648
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,687
I think I've broken something.

649
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,948
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

650
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:52,497
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

651
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,990
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

652
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:04,772
That's mine.

653
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:08,993
That's nice, Merry.

654
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:11,487
Here's a nice one, Sam.

655
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,980
I think we should get off the road.

656
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:24,242
Get off the road!

657
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:25,776
Quick!

658
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,396
Be quiet!

659
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:45,093
What was that?

660
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,893
Anything?

661
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,003
Nothing.

662
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,880
What is going on?

663
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:26,908
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

664
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:29,689
Frodo?

665
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:31,416
Get down!

666
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,734
I have to leave the Shire.

667
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:52,995
Sam and I must get to Bree.

668
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:54,529
Right.

669
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:57,982
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

670
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:07,190
Run!

671
00:54:08,436 --> 00:54:10,259
This way! Follow me!

672
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:14,766
Run!

673
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:29,153
Get the rope, Sam!

674
00:54:31,742 --> 00:54:33,181
Frodo!

675
00:54:33,948 --> 00:54:35,195
Run, Frodo!

676
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:36,633
Go!
- Hurry!

677
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:39,223
Frodo, come on!

678
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,196
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

679
00:54:56,582 --> 00:55:00,418
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

680
00:55:14,613 --> 00:55:16,052
Come on.

681
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:29,958
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

682
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,096
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

683
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:39,933
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

684
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:43,481
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

685
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,934
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

686
00:55:47,221 --> 00:55:49,523
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

687
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,592
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

688
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:54,798
Can't be too careful.

689
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,953
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

690
00:56:40,162 --> 00:56:41,601
Excuse me.

691
00:56:42,656 --> 00:56:45,245
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

692
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:51,096
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

693
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:55,892
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

694
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:58,961
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

695
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:02,605
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

696
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:05,770
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

697
00:57:06,249 --> 00:57:07,880
Gandalf.

698
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:10,277
Oh, yes...

699
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:12,483
...I remember. Elderly chap.

700
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:15,648
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

701
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,759
Not seen him for six months.

702
00:57:24,376 --> 00:57:25,623
What do we do now?

703
00:57:32,528 --> 00:57:33,679
Sam...

704
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:35,597
...he'll be here. He'll come.

705
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:40,296
Get out of my way!

706
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:44,229
What's that?

707
00:57:44,229 --> 00:57:46,723
This, my friend, is a pint.

708
00:57:47,106 --> 00:57:48,545
It comes in pints?

709
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:52,285
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

710
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:02,067
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

711
00:58:05,713 --> 00:58:07,055
Excuse me.

712
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:11,563
That man in the corner. Who is he?

713
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,934
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

714
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:21,441
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

715
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:24,989
Strider.

716
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:40,527
<i>Baggins...</i>

717
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:46,377
<i>Baggins...</i>

718
00:58:50,597 --> 00:58:52,803
<i>Baggins...</i>

719
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:56,352
<i>Baggins...</i>

720
00:58:57,023 --> 00:58:59,805
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

721
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:02,969
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

722
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:06,134
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

723
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:08,340
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

724
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:14,382
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

725
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:45,073
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

726
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,827
<i>I see you.</i>

727
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,143
<i>There is no life...</i>

728
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:57,349
<i>...in the void.</i>

729
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:58,979
<i>Only...</i>

730
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:01,377
<i>...death.</i>

731
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:11,640
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

732
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:17,202
What do you want?

733
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,408
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

734
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,669
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

735
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,354
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

736
01:00:25,642 --> 01:00:28,998
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

737
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,067
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

738
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:34,274
Yes.

739
01:00:34,274 --> 01:00:38,110
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

740
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,344
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

741
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:49,906
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

742
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,975
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

743
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:54,222
They're coming.

744

749
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,964
They were once men.

750
01:02:20,252 --> 01:02:22,266
Great kings of men.

751
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:25,718
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

752
01:02:26,486 --> 01:02:29,363
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

753
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,719
One by one, falling into darkness.

754
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:35,309
Now they are slaves to his will.

755
01:02:37,707 --> 01:02:39,242
They are the Nazgûl.

756
01:02:39,242 --> 01:02:41,927
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

757
01:02:42,886 --> 01:02:44,229
At all times they feel...

758
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:46,147
... the presence of the ring...

759
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:50,558
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

760
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:03,027
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

761
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:14,727
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

762
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:17,796
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

763
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,824
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

764
01:03:22,495 --> 01:03:25,181
We have no choice but to trust him.

765
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,538
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

766
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:34,005
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

767
01:03:34,676 --> 01:03:37,266
We're going to see the elves.

768
01:03:58,078 --> 01:04:02,010
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

769
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:04,887
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

770
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:07,189
What about second breakfast?

771
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:13,327
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

772
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:18,602
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

773
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:22,822
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

774
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:29,727
Pippin!

775

What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,420
Bilbo.

922
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:06,037
There and back again

923
01:24:06,037 --> 01:24:08,626
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

924
01:24:11,695 --> 01:24:14,956
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

925
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,888
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

926
01:24:19,463 --> 01:24:21,573
...visit Lake-town...

927
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:25,027
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

928
01:24:25,698 --> 01:24:30,110
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

929
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:43,632
I miss the Shire.

930
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:48,812
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

931
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:52,552
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

932
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:58,786
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

933
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:06,938
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

934
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:10,295
My dear boy.

935
01:25:14,419 --> 01:25:17,968
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

936
01:25:18,831 --> 01:25:20,461
No harm in being prepared.

937
01:25:20,749 --> 01:25:23,147
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

938
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:26,024
- More than anything.
- I did.

939
01:25:26,407 --> 01:25:28,230
It's just....

940
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:31,394
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

941
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:35,039
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

942
01:25:35,518 --> 01:25:38,492
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

943
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,314
Off home.

944
01:25:44,342 --> 01:25:46,165
You are right, Sam.

945
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,960
We did what we set out to do.

946
01:25:51,535 --> 01:25:53,933
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

947
01:25:57,961 --> 01:26:00,167
I am ready to go home.

948
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:02,757
His strength returns.

949
01:26:03,045 --> 01:26:08,319
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

950
01:26:09,183 --> 01:26:11,484
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

951
01:26:11,484 --> 01:26:15,129
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

952
01:26:15,512 --> 01:26:18,677
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

953
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:23,952
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

954
01:26:24,335 --> 01:26:28,652
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

955
01:26:29,036 --> 01:26:31,529
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

956
01:26:31,913 --> 01:26:34,886
Our list of allies grows thin.

957
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:38,242
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

958
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:41,887
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

959
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,476
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

960
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:49,080
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

961
01:26:49,463 --> 01:26:51,670
Saruman is coming for the ring.

962
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:55,890
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

963
01:26:56,273 --> 01:27:00,301
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

964
01:27:04,138 --> 01:27:05,097
Gandalf...

965
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:08,741
...the ring cannot stay here.

966
01:27:27,635 --> 01:27:30,608
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

967
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:33,485
They must decide now how to end it.

968
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,801
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

969
01:27:38,568 --> 01:27:41,926
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

970
01:27:42,309 --> 01:27:47,009
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

971
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,324
It is in men that we must place our hope.

972
01:27:51,804 --> 01:27:53,338
Men?

973
01:27:54,297 --> 01:27:57,174
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

974
01:27:57,558 --> 01:28:01,586
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

975
01:28:02,065 --> 01:28:05,326
It is because of men the ring survives.

976
01:28:05,711 --> 01:28:07,149
I was there, Gandalf.

977
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:10,506
I was there 3000 years ago...

978
01:28:17,123 --> 01:28:19,329
... when Isildur took the ring.

979
01:28:19,617 --> 01:28:23,165
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

980
01:28:25,755 --> 01:28:28,152
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

981
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:33,140
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

982
01:28:33,524 --> 01:28:36,785
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

983
01:28:36,785 --> 01:28:39,374
Cast it into the fire!

984
01:28:44,457 --> 01:28:47,910
- Destroy it!
- No.

985
01:28:49,348 --> 01:28:51,362
Isildur!

986
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:56,254
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

987
01:29:00,378 --> 01:29:04,310
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

988
01:29:05,269 --> 01:29:08,722
There's no strength left in the world of men.

989
01:29:09,105 --> 01:29:13,517
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

990
01:29:13,901 --> 01:29:16,969
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

991
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:22,245
He turned from that path a long time ago.

992
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:24,547
He has chosen exile.

993
01:29:54,374 --> 01:29:56,196
You are no elf.

994
01:29:56,484 --> 01:29:58,402
Men of the South are welcome here.

995
01:29:59,073 --> 01:30:02,334
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

996
01:30:03,868 --> 01:30:06,458
Then we are here on common purpose...

997
01:30:06,842 --> 01:30:08,184
...friend.

998
01:30:22,954 --> 01:30:25,640
The shards of Narsil.

999
01:30:29,092 --> 01:30:33,120
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

1000
01:30:36,094 --> 01:30:38,204
It's still sharp.

1001
01:30:46,835 --> 01:30:49,617
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1002
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:18,389
Why do you fear the past?

1003
01:31:19,252 --> 01:31:24,144
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

1004
01:31:24,624 --> 01:31:27,788
You are not bound to his fate.

1005
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:32,008
The same blood flows in my veins.

1006
01:31:35,077 --> 01:31:37,475
The same weakness.

1007
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,749
Your time will come.

1008
01:31:43,037 --> 01:31:47,065
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

1009
01:31:49,809 --> 01:31:52,408
[Sindarin] <i>A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn.</i>
[English] The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn.

1010
01:31:53,357 --> 01:31:56,800
[Sindarin] <i>Ú or le a ú or nin.</i>
[English] Not over you, not over me.

1011
01:32:07,503 --> 01:32:10,611
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i lú i erui govannem?</i>
[English] Do you remember when we first met?

1012
01:32:13,959 --> 01:32:17,823
[Sindarin] <i>Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.</i>
[English] I thought I had strayed into a dream.

1013
01:32:18,687 --> 01:32:21,257
[Sindarin] <i>Gwenwin in enninath.</i>
[English] Long years have passed.

1014
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:25,764
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.</i>
[English] You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

1015
01:32:27,529 --> 01:32:29,735
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i beth i pennen?</i>
[English] Do you remember what I told you?

1016
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:38,185
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

1017
01:32:40,295 --> 01:32:44,802
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

1018
01:32:46,049 --> 01:32:47,871
And to that I hold.

1019
01:32:47,871 --> 01:32:51,420
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

1020
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:55,352
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

1021
01:33:03,888 --> 01:33:07,053
I choose a mortal life.

1022
01:33:08,492 --> 01:33:12,424
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

1023
01:33:15,684 --> 01:33:17,986
...like my heart.

1024
01:33:33,236 --> 01:33:36,688
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

1025
01:33:37,072 --> 01:33:40,620
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

1026
01:33:41,388 --> 01:33:45,895
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

1027
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:49,539
You will unite, or you will fall.

1028
01:33:49,923 --> 01:33:53,856
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

1029
01:33:55,774 --> 01:33:58,939
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

1030
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:14,188
So it is true.

1031
01:34:23,587 --> 01:34:25,026
<i>The ring of power...</i>

1032
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,478
<i>The doom of men...</i>

1033
01:34:30,972 --> 01:34:32,890
In a dream...

1034
01:34:34,616 --> 01:34:37,589
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1035
01:34:37,877 --> 01:34:39,507
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

1036
01:34:40,276 --> 01:34:42,002
A voice was crying:

1037
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,975
"Your doom is near at hand.

1038
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:48,619
Isildur's bane is found."

1039
01:34:50,662 --> 01:34:52,005
(The Ring)
[Black Speech] <i>Sherkuk-ishi</i>
[English] In your blood

1040
01:34:52,455 --> 01:34:54,182
Isildur s bane.

1041
01:34:54,757 --> 01:34:55,045
Boromir!

1042
01:34:55,007 --> 01:34:58,622
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1043
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:58,891
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu...</i>
{\an8} [English] Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...

1044
01:34:58,622 --> 01:35:02,180
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them...

1045
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:06,100
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ombi kuzd-durbagu... shirku</i>
{\an8} [English] Seven for the Dwarf-lords... blood

1046
01:35:02,381 --> 01:35:05,423
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg thrakatulûk...</i>
[English] ...One ring to bring them all...

1047
01:35:06,405 --> 01:35:09,725
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ash Burz-Durbagu burzum-ishi...</i>
{\an8} [English] One for the Dark lord on his dark throne...

1048
01:35:08,213 --> 01:35:12,356
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.</i>
[English] ...and in the darkness bind them.

1049
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:21,803
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1050
01:35:22,187 --> 01:35:25,543
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

1051
01:35:25,831 --> 01:35:27,749
...for the black speech of Mordor...

1052
01:35:28,133 --> 01:35:29,379
...may yet be heard...

1053
01:35:29,668 --> 01:35:32,353
...in every corner of the West!

1054
01:35:32,641 --> 01:35:35,135
The ring is altogether evil.

1055
01:35:35,614 --> 01:35:36,957
It is a gift.

1056
01:35:37,724 --> 01:35:39,546
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1057
01:35:40,218 --> 01:35:42,136
Why not use this ring?

1058
01:35:42,423 --> 01:35:45,013
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

1059
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:49,233
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1060
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:51,726
...are your lands kept safe.

1061
01:35:53,452 --> 01:35:57,481
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1062
01:35:57,865 --> 01:36:01,317
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1063
01:36:02,085 --> 01:36:05,825
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1064
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:09,469
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1065
01:36:09,757 --> 01:36:11,579
This is no mere ranger.

1066
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:15,991
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1067
01:36:16,662 --> 01:36:19,348
You owe him your allegiance.

1068
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:25,199
Aragorn.

1069
01:36:26,925 --> 01:36:29,610
This is Isildur s heir?

1070
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:34,501
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1071
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:37,743
[Sindarin] <i>Havo dad, Legolas.</i>
[English] Sit down, Legolas.

1072
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,805
Gondor has no king.

1073
01:36:45,723 --> 01:36:47,257
Gondor needs no king.

1074
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:57,040
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1075
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:01,355
You have only one choice.

1076
01:37:01,643 --> 01:37:03,849
The ring must be destroyed.

1077
01:37:08,933 --> 01:37:11,330
What are we waiting for?

1078
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:21,268
[Black Speech] <i>Daghburz-ishi makha, ghurarmu shirku.</i>
[English] In the land of Mordor, a sacrifice of blood.

1079
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:25,812
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1080
01:37:26,195 --> 01:37:30,128
...by any craft that we here possess.

1081
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:34,540
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1082
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,472
Only there can it be unmade.

1083
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:42,021
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1084
01:37:42,308 --> 01:37:46,432
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1085
01:37:45,862 --> 01:37:48,772
[Black Speech] <i>Makha gulshu darulu.</i>
[English] Where the Shadows lie.

1086
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,844
One of you...

1087
01:37:51,419 --> 01:37:53,433
...must do this.

1088
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:59,764
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1089
01:38:00,723 --> 01:38:04,079
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1090
01:38:04,943 --> 01:38:08,779
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1091
01:38:09,162 --> 01:38:13,094
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1092
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,780
It is a barren wasteland...

1093
01:38:16,163 --> 01:38:19,328
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1094
01:38:19,712 --> 01:38:23,357
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1095
01:38:23,645 --> 01:38:27,577
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1096
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:32,084
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1097
01:38:32,468 --> 01:38:34,770
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1098
01:38:35,057 --> 01:38:39,373
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1099
01:38:39,757 --> 01:38:44,648
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1100
01:38:46,758 --> 01:38:49,060
Never trust an elf!

1101
01:38:50,307 --> 01:38:55,678
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1102
01:38:56,157 --> 01:38:58,843
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1103
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:02,036
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1104
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:04,443
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1105
01:39:04,453 --> 01:39:06,457
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1106
01:39:06,467 --> 01:39:08,481
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1107
01:39:08,481 --> 01:39:10,389
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1108
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:12,510
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1109
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:14,332
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1110
01:39:16,874 --> 01:39:18,792
I will take it.

1111
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:23,395
I will take it.

1112
01:39:28,957 --> 01:39:31,835
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1113
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:40,851
Though...

1114
01:39:43,919 --> 01:39:45,646
...I do not know the way.

1115
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:51,496
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1116
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,044
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1117
01:39:56,195 --> 01:39:59,072
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1118
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,087
...I will.

1119
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:06,362
You have my sword.

1120
01:40:08,184 --> 01:40:10,102
And you have my bow.

1121
01:40:10,774 --> 01:40:12,979
And my ax.

1122
01:40:19,884 --> 01:40:22,570
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1123
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:28,037
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1124
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:31,010
...then Gondor will see it done.

1125
01:40:33,504 --> 01:40:37,915
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1126
01:40:38,299 --> 01:40:42,807
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1127
01:40:43,478 --> 01:40:45,204
Oy. We're coming too!

1128
01:40:47,314 --> 01:40:49,903
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1129
01:40:49,903 --> 01:40:53,165
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1130
01:40:53,645 --> 01:40:54,795
...mission.

1131
01:40:54,795 --> 01:40:56,282
Quest.

1132
01:40:56,762 --> 01:40:57,721
Thing.

1133
01:40:59,447 --> 01:41:02,036
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1134
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:05,393
Nine companions.

1135
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,845
So be it.

1136
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:12,106
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1137
01:41:12,778 --> 01:41:14,504
Great!

1138
01:41:14,888 --> 01:41:16,902
Where are we going?
