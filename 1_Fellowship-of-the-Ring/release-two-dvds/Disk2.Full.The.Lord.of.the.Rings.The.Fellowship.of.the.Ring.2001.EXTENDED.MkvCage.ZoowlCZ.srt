{\an8} [English] ♫ Hope, you are your father’s son... ♫

[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

4
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:42,250
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

5
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,512
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

6
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,812
That you'd never escape your fate.

7
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,712
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

8
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:59,112
...but only you have the power to wield it.

9
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,712
I do not want that power.

10
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,612
I have never wanted it.

11
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:09,412
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

12
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:16,312
My old sword! Sting.

13
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:17,812
Here, take it. Take it.

14
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:27,012
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

15
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:31,812
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

16
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:36,712
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

17
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,412
Here's a pretty thing.

18
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:41,112
Mithril.

19
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:46,212
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

20
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:49,712
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

21
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,912
My old ring.

22
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:05,012
I should very much like...

23
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:09,212
...to hold it again, one last time.

24
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,212
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

25
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:34,612
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

26
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:42,312
I'm sorry for everything.

27
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:01,512
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

28
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:05,412
On you who travel with him, no oath...

29
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,812
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

30
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:14,712
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

31
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:19,012
May the blessings of elves and men...

32
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,312
...and all free folk go with you.

33
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:29,312
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

34
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:50,412
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

35
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,812
Left.

36
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,612
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

37
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:20,612
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

38
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,612
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

39
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:28,512
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

40
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:31,512
Move your feet.

41
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,012
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

42
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,712
Faster!

43
00:05:36,012 --> 00:05:39,712
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

44
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,612
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

45
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:46,212
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

46
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:50,612
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

47
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:56,212
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

48
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:06,812
Sorry!

49
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,012
Get him!

50
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,812
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

51
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,712
Gentlemen, that's enough.

52
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,112
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

53
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:24,212
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

54
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,112
It's moving fast.

55
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,612
Against the wind.

56
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,512
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

57
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:35,412
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

58
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,612
Spies of Saruman.

59
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:14,512
The passage south is being watched.

60
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:19,112
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

61
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,312
Frodo!

Give the ring to Frodo.

00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:24,412
As you wish.

72
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,212
I care not.

73
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:07,112
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

74
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:12,012
And if that fails, where then will you go?

75
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,312
If the mountain defeats you...

76
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:20,912

00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,912
It's Saruman!

80
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:52,312
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

87
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:02,812
We must get off the mountain!

88
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:07,512
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

89
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:11,112
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

90
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:15,012
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

91
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,112
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

92
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,612
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

93
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:29,312
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

94
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:35,112
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

95
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:39,812
Shadow and flame.

96
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,012
Let the ring-bearer decide.

97
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,912
We cannot stay here!

98
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,812
This will be the death of the hobbits.

99
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:57,712
Frodo?

100
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:03,512
We will go through the mines.

101
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,312
So be it.

102
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:16,712
Frodo, come and help an old man.

103
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,512
How is your shoulder?

104
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,912
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

105
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,112
You feel its power growing, don't you?

106
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:33,412
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

107
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:37,712
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

108
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:40,512
And, I fear, from within.

109
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:47,312
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

110
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:50,312
Trust your own strengths.

111
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:53,212
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

112
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:55,412
...for good or for evil.

113
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,912
Some are greater than I am.

114
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,912
And against some I have not yet been tested.

115
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:04,812
The walls...

116
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,612
...of Moria.

117
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,312
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

118
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:20,812
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

119
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:23,812
Why doesn't that surprise me?

120
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,012
Well, let's see.

121
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:36,812
Ithildin.

122
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:40,712
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

123
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:59,312
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

124
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:04,312
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

125
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:09,012
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

126
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,760
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

127
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:28,082
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

128
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:33,912
Nothing's happening.

129
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:45,112
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

130
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,312
...men and orcs.

131
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:49,812
What are you going to do, then?

132
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:52,212
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

133
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,412
And if that does not shatter them...

134
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:57,312
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

135
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:00,912
...I will try to find the opening words.

136
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:06,322
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

137
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,822
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

138
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:12,922
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

139
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,312
Mines are no place for a pony.

140
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:20,512
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

141
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:21,912
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

142
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:24,612
Go on, Bill. Go on.

143
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,812
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

144
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:38,112
Do not disturb the water.

145
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,312
Oh, it's useless.

146
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,112
It's a riddle.

147
00:15:57,912 --> 00:16:01,012
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

148
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,312
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

149
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,549
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

150
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:07,012
Mellon.

151
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:29,812
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

152
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:35,912
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

153
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:40,612
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

154
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,512
And they call it a mine.

155
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:45,612
A mine!

156
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,912
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

157
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:57,712
No....

158
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,612
No!

159
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,812
Goblins.

160
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:12,912
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

161
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:16,612
Now, get out of here. Get out!

162
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:21,812
- Frodo!
- Help!

163
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:23,712
Strider!

164
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:26,512
- Help!
- Get off him!

165
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,812
Aragorn!

166
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:39,312
Frodo!

167
00:18:05,612 --> 00:18:06,712
Into the mines!

168
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,012
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

169
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,112
Run!

170
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,612
We now have but one choice.

171
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:41,512
We must face the long dark of Moria.

172
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,912
Be on your guard.

173
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:47,512
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

174
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:51,212
...in the deep places of the world.

175
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:03,012
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

176
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:07,112
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

177
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:56,612
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

178
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,312
...or jewels...

179
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:02,512
...but mithril.

180
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,612
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

181
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:29,912
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

182
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,012
I never told him...

183
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:37,012
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

184
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,212
Pippin.

185
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,412
I have no memory of this place.

186
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,012
- Are we Lost?
- No.

187
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,712
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

188
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,412
- Merry?
- What?

189
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,512
I'm hungry.

190
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:40,212
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

191
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:44,512
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

192
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:49,012
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

193
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:51,412
...or was set loose.

194
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:55,512
Now the ring has brought him here.

195
00:21:58,212 --> 00:22:00,912
He will never be rid of his need for it.

196
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:06,712
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

197
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:11,812
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

198
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:17,912
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

199
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:21,812
Before it drove him mad.

200
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:24,912
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

201
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,312
Pity?

202
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:30,312
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

203
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:36,312
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

204
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:40,412
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

205
00:22:42,912 --> 00:22:46,712
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

206
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:49,812
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

207
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:56,212
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

208
00:22:57,312 --> 00:23:00,012
...before this is over.

209
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:05,312
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

210
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:15,412
I wish the ring had never come to me.

211
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,912
I wish none of this had happened.

212
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:23,912
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

213
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:30,312
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

214
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:35,812
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

215
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:38,812
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

216
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:43,512
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

217
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:46,912
And that is an encouraging thought.

218
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:53,812
It's that way.

219
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,312
- He's remembered.
- No.

220
00:23:56,612 --> 00:24:00,212
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

221
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,512
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

222
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:24,612
Let me risk a little more light.

223
00:24:29,412 --> 00:24:31,412
Behold...

224
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:37,012
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

225
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,912
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

226
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:09,712
Gimli!

227
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:18,712
No!

228
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,412
Oh, no.

229
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,512
No.

230
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:36,812
"Here lies Balin...

231
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,312
...son of Fundin...

232
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,212
...Lord of Moria."

233
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:44,912
He is dead, then.

234
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,412
It's as I feared.

235
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,512
We must move on. We cannot linger.

236
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:14,312
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

237
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:18,112
We have barred the gates...

238
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:21,212
...but cannot hold them for long.

239
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,212
The ground shakes.

240
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:26,212
Drums...

241
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:29,912
...drums in the deep.

242
00:26:33,712 --> 00:26:35,612
We cannot get out.

243
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:41,412
A shadow moves in the dark.

244
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:45,712
We cannot get out.

245
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,612
They are coming."

246
00:27:33,812 --> 00:27:35,612
Fool of a Took!

247
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:39,612
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

248
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:07,412
Frodo!

249
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,212
Orcs.

250
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:20,212
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

251
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:29,212
They have a cave-troll.

252
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:46,212
Let them come!

253
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:50,012
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

254
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:11,812
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

255
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:18,312
Frodo!

256
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,612
Aragorn! Aragorn!

257
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,512
Frodo!

258
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,612
Frodo!

259
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:45,212
Oh, no.

260
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:55,412
He's alive.

261
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:00,812
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

262
00:34:01,112 --> 00:34:03,212
You should be dead.

263
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,912
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

264
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:10,812
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

265
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:17,912
Mithril.

266
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:23,212
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

267
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:31,012
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

268
00:34:46,212 --> 00:34:47,812
This way!

269
00:35:58,312 --> 00:36:01,112
What is this new devilry?

270
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:20,112
A Balrog.

271
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,512
A demon of the ancient world.

272
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,112
This foe is beyond any of you.

273
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:30,912
Run!

274
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,712
Quickly!

275
00:36:56,412 --> 00:36:57,712
Gandalf.

276
00:36:58,312 --> 00:36:59,812
Lead them on, Aragorn.

277
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,812
The bridge is near.

278
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:09,812
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

279
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:40,712
Gandalf!

280
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,312
Merry! Pippin!

281
00:38:11,512 --> 00:38:12,912
Sam!

282
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,812
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

283
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:23,412
Not the beard!

284
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:38,612
Steady.

285
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,212
Hold on!

286
00:39:03,412 --> 00:39:04,612
Hang on!

287
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,012
Lean forward!

288
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:21,012
Steady.

289
00:39:22,412 --> 00:39:23,512
Come on!

290
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:25,212
Now!

291
00:39:42,412 --> 00:39:44,112
Over the bridge!

292
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,912
Fly!

293
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,612
You cannot pass!

294
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:34,512
Gandalf!

295
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:43,512
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

296
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:48,312
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

297
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:00,412
Go back to the Shadow.

298
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:12,512
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

299
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:43,512
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

300
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:53,712
Fly, you fools!

301
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,012
No!

302
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,312
Aragorn!

303
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:08,512
Legolas, get them up.

304
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:14,412
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

305
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:18,212
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

306
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:21,712
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

307
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:26,012
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

308
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:29,812
On your feet, Sam.

309
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,612
Frodo?

310
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,312

Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

Speak words we can all understand!

00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:57,612
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

Nor would he have you give up hope.

You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

351
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:15,812
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

I can no longer see him from afar.

366
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:32,212
Gandalf the Grey did not pass

What now becomes of this fellowship?

379
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,812
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

380
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:52,112
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

381
00:50:52,112 --> 00:50:55,212
Stray but a little and it will fail...

382
00:50:56,212 --> 00:50:58,912
...to the ruin of all.

383
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:08,912
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

01:02:51,512 --> 01:02:55,412
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

506
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:58,212
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

507
01:02:58,512 --> 01:03:02,212
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

508
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:07,412
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

509
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:17,986
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

510
01:03:20,312 --> 01:03:24,712
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

511
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:46,812
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

512
01:03:47,212 --> 01:03:50,512
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

513
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:58,512
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

514
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:02,612
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

515
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:05,112
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

516
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:08,512
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

517
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:12,512
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

518
01:04:12,512 --> 01:04:15,412
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

519
01:04:15,412 --> 01:04:17,612
Thank you, my lady.

520
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:22,712
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

521
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:32,112
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

522
01:04:32,512 --> 01:04:34,612
Nothing.

523
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:38,512
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

524
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:44,212
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

525
01:04:51,412 --> 01:04:52,912
Actually....

526
01:04:53,212 --> 01:04:54,812
There was one thing.

527
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:58,212
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossible.

528
01:04:58,512 --> 01:05:01,212
Stupid to ask.

529
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:05,912
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

530
01:05:05,912 --> 01:05:09,612
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

531
01:05:10,315 --> 01:05:11,358
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

532
01:05:12,634 --> 01:05:17,889
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

533
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,877
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

534
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:25,923
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

535
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:34,638
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

536
01:05:35,112 --> 01:05:38,012
That choice is yet before her.

537
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:41,712
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

538
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:47,612
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

539
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:52,312
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

540
01:05:59,397 --> 01:06:00,432
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

541
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:07,589
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

542
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:11,389
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

543
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:17,532
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

544
01:06:20,112 --> 01:06:23,212
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

545
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:26,712
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

546
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:29,912
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

547
01:06:39,112 --> 01:06:43,312
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

548
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:47,712
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

549
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:59,812
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

550
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:04,612
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

551
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:08,812
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

552
01:07:09,212 --> 01:07:11,112
What was her gift?

553
01:07:11,412 --> 01:07:16,112
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

554
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:19,812
She gave me three.

555
01:09:02,112 --> 01:09:05,412
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

556
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,212
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

557
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:15,612
But he's too clever a waterman.

558
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:19,812
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

559
01:09:19,812 --> 01:09:22,112
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

560
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,412
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

561
01:09:24,712 --> 01:09:27,712
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

562
01:09:28,112 --> 01:09:31,012
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

563
01:09:32,012 --> 01:09:34,912
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

564
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,312
But you're not.

565
01:09:36,712 --> 01:09:39,212
I'm here to help you.

566
01:09:39,212 --> 01:09:41,012
I promised Gandalf that I would.

567
01:09:47,112 --> 01:09:49,612
You can't help me, Sam.

568
01:09:52,012 --> 01:09:53,612
Not this time.

569
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:58,612
Get some sleep.

570
01:10:05,012 --> 01:10:07,112
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

571
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:10,312
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

572
01:10:11,112 --> 01:10:13,212
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

573
01:10:13,612 --> 01:10:16,312
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

574
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,912
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

575
01:10:20,812 --> 01:10:23,612
Have you so little faith in your own people?

576
01:10:23,612 --> 01:10:26,612
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

577
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:30,212
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

578
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,612
But you will not see that.

579
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:34,412
You are afraid!

580
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:37,212
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

581
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:40,912
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

582
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:47,712
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

583
01:10:59,712 --> 01:11:01,012
Frodo.

584
01:11:02,912 --> 01:11:04,312
The Argonath.

590
01:12:35,712 --> 01:12:38,112
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

591
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:41,712
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

592
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:46,012
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

593
01:12:46,312 --> 01:12:49,412
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

594
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:52,712
And after that, it gets even better.

595
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:57,912
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

596
01:12:58,412 --> 01:12:59,712
That is our road.

597
01:13:01,312 --> 01:13:04,412
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

598
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:06,312
Recover my...

599
01:13:09,512 --> 01:13:11,312
- We should Leave now.
- No.

600
01:13:11,612 --> 01:13:15,812
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

601
01:13:16,212 --> 01:13:19,612
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

602
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:23,712
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

603
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:28,412
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

604
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:35,312
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

605
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:37,712
Where's Frodo?

606
01:14:03,412 --> 01:14:05,312
None of us should wander alone.

607
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:08,712
You, least of all.

608
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:11,312
So much depends on you.

609
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:14,412
Frodo?

610
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:24,112
I know why you seek solitude.

611
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:28,212
You suffer. I see it day by day.

612
01:14:29,112 --> 01:14:32,112
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

613
01:14:33,812 --> 01:14:36,412
There are other ways, Frodo.

614
01:14:36,712 --> 01:14:40,412
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

615
01:14:40,712 --> 01:14:44,312
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

616
01:14:44,712 --> 01:14:47,712
Warning...against what?

617
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:50,012
We're all afraid, Frodo.

618
01:14:50,312 --> 01:14:53,812
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

619
01:14:54,212 --> 01:14:57,812
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

620
01:14:59,812 --> 01:15:02,912
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

621
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:06,612
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

622
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:11,412
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

623
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:16,612
What chance do you think you have?

624
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:21,412
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

625
01:15:21,812 --> 01:15:25,412
And you will beg for death before the end!

626
01:15:27,712 --> 01:15:29,712
You fool!

627
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:33,812
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

628
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:36,812
It should be mine! Give it to me!

629
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:38,312
- Give it to me!
- No!

630
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:40,412
- Give it to me!
- No.

631
01:15:48,112 --> 01:15:50,012
I see your mind.

632
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:53,212
You will take the ring to Sauron!

633
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:55,312
You will betray us!

634
01:15:55,612 --> 01:15:58,712
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

635
01:15:59,212 --> 01:16:02,712
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:27,412
Run, Frodo. Go!

674
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:31,012
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

675
01:20:31,612 --> 01:20:33,112
- Over here!
- This way!

676
01:20:44,112 --> 01:20:46,312
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

677
01:21:41,712 --> 01:21:44,612
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

678
01:22:27,912 --> 01:22:28,912
Run!

679
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:02,112
No.

680
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:09,112
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

681
01:26:09,412 --> 01:26:11,412
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

682
01:26:13,412 --> 01:26:14,812
I let Frodo go.

683
01:26:15,512 --> 01:26:18,012
Then you did what I could not.

684
01:26:19,112 --> 01:26:22,312
I tried to take the ring from him.

685
01:26:22,912 --> 01:26:27,012
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

686
01:26:27,412 --> 01:26:29,612
I did not see it.

687
01:26:29,912 --> 01:26:33,012
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

688
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:36,012
You fought bravely.

689
01:26:36,412 --> 01:26:38,912
You have kept your honor.

690
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:41,412
Leave it.

691
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:43,912
It is over.

692
01:26:45,212 --> 01:26:50,312
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

693
01:26:50,912 --> 01:26:53,712
...and my city to ruin.

694
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,612
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

695
01:27:00,612 --> 01:27:04,712
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

696
01:27:05,812 --> 01:27:08,212
...nor our people fail.

697
01:27:09,212 --> 01:27:10,612
Our people.

698
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:16,512
Our people.

699
01:27:38,312 --> 01:27:41,212
I would have followed you, my brother.

700
01:27:42,912 --> 01:27:44,812
My captain.

701
01:27:47,612 --> 01:27:49,412
My king.

702
01:28:09,112 --> 01:28:11,212
Be at peace...

703
01:28:11,812 --> 01:28:13,612
...son of Gondor.

704
01:28:30,112 --> 01:28:33,312
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

705
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:36,912
But he will not return.

706
01:29:00,312 --> 01:29:02,212
Frodo!

707
01:29:21,712 --> 01:29:24,912
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

708
01:29:26,212 --> 01:29:29,012
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

709
01:29:32,212 --> 01:29:34,912
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

710
01:29:35,212 --> 01:29:38,512
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

711
01:29:38,912 --> 01:29:41,412
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

712
01:29:41,712 --> 01:29:46,312
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

713
01:30:15,212 --> 01:30:17,212
Frodo, no!

714
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:19,212
Frodo!

715
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:22,512
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

716
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,112
Go back, Sam!

717
01:30:28,712 --> 01:30:32,112
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

718
01:30:32,412 --> 01:30:35,112
And I'm coming with you!

719
01:30:35,812 --> 01:30:38,112
You can't swim!

720
01:30:41,912 --> 01:30:43,612
Sam!

721
01:30:49,212 --> 01:30:50,612
Sam!

722
01:31:31,512 --> 01:31:34,212
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

723
01:31:34,612 --> 01:31:38,712
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

724
01:31:40,012 --> 01:31:42,512
And I don't mean to.

725
01:31:42,912 --> 01:31:45,012
I don't mean to.

726
01:31:46,812 --> 01:31:48,512
Oh Sam.

727
01:32:03,512 --> 01:32:05,112
Come on.

728
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:37,912
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

729
01:32:53,012 --> 01:32:57,912
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

730
01:33:01,412 --> 01:33:06,112
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

731
01:33:18,112 --> 01:33:21,212
Not if we hold true to each other.

732
01:33:22,712 --> 01:33:27,012
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

733
01:33:28,112 --> 01:33:33,212
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

734
01:33:34,712 --> 01:33:36,612
We travel light.

735
01:33:36,912 --> 01:33:38,812
Let us hunt some orc.

736
01:33:41,812 --> 01:33:43,812
Yes!

737
01:34:02,812 --> 01:34:04,212
Mordor.

738
01:34:04,912 --> 01:34:08,112
I hope the others find a safer road.

739
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:11,712
Strider will look after them.

740
01:34:12,812 --> 01:34:16,012
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

741
01:34:16,512 --> 01:34:18,812
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

742
01:34:18,812 --> 01:34:20,512
We may.

743
01:34:22,712 --> 01:34:23,812
Sam...

744
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:29,912
...I'm glad you are with me.
