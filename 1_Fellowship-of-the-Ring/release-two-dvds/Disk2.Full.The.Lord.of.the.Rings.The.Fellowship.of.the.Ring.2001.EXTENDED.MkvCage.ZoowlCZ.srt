{\an8} [English] ♫ Hope, you are your father’s son... ♫

00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,539
[Sindarin] <i>Anirne hene beriad i chên lîn.</i>
[English] She wanted to protect her child.

4
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:42,254
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

5
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:48,516
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

6
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,817
That you'd never escape your fate.

7
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,717
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

8
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:59,117
...but only you have the power to wield it.

9
00:01:00,317 --> 00:01:02,718
I do not want that power.

10
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:05,618
I have never wanted it.

11
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:09,418
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

12
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,319
My old sword! Sting.

13
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,819
Here, take it. Take it.

14
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,020
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

15
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,820
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,721
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

17
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,421
Here's a pretty thing.

18
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,121
Mithril.

19
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:46,222
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

20
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:49,722
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

21
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,923
My old ring.

22
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:05,023
I should very much like...

23
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:09,224
...to hold it again, one last time.

24
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,226
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

25
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:34,626
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

26
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,327
I'm sorry for everything.

27
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:01,528
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

28
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:05,429
On you who travel with him, no oath...

29
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,829
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

30
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,730
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

31
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,030
May the blessings of elves and men...

32
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,330
...and all free folk go with you.

33
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,331
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

34
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,433
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

35
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,833
Left.

36
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,640
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

37
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,641
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

38
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:24,640
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

39
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:28,542
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

40
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,541
Move your feet.

41
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,042
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

42
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,742
Faster!

43
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:39,743
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

44
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:42,643
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

45
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,243
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

46
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:50,644
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

47
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:56,244
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

48
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:06,845
Sorry!

49
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,045
Get him!

50
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,846
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

51
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:15,746
Gentlemen, that's enough.

52
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,146
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

53
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,247
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

54
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:27,147
It's moving fast.

55
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,647
Against the wind.

56
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:32,547
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

57
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,448
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

58
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,651
Spies of Saruman.

59
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,551
The passage south is being watched.

60
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:19,152
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

61
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,353
Frodo!

00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,556
Give the ring to Frodo.

71
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:24,457
As you wish.

72
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,258
I care not.

73
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:07,161
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

74
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:12,062
And if that fails, where then will you go?

75
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:16,362
If the mountain defeats you...

76
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:20,962
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

78
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:36,264
There is a fell voice on the air.

79
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:38,964
It's Saruman!

80
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:52,365
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

81
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,566
No!

87
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,872
We must get off the mountain!

88
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,572
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

89
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:11,172
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

90
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:15,073
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

91
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:18,173
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

92
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:23,674
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

93
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:29,374
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

94
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:35,175
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

95
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,875
Shadow and flame.

96
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:46,076
Let the ring-bearer decide.

97
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,975
We cannot stay here!

98
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,876
This will be the death of the hobbits.

99
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,777
Frodo?

100
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:03,577
We will go through the mines.

101
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:06,377
So be it.

102
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,778
Frodo, come and help an old man.

103
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,579
How is your shoulder?

104
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,979
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

105
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,180
You feel its power growing, don't you?

106
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,480
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

107
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,780
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

108
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,580
And, I fear, from within.

109
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:47,381
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

110
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,381
Trust your own strengths.

111
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,281
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

112
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,482
...for good or for evil.

113
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,982
Some are greater than I am.

114
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,982
And against some I have not yet been tested.

115
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,883
The walls...

116
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,683
...of Moria.

117
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:16,384
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

118
00:13:16,684 --> 00:13:20,884
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

119
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,884
Why doesn't that surprise me?

120
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:35,085
Well, let's see.

121
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,886
Ithildin.

122
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:40,786
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

123
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:59,388
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

124
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,387
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

125
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:09,088
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

126
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:13,837
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>
[English] Gate of the elves, open now for me!

127
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,160
[Sindarin] <i>Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.</i>
[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.

128
00:14:32,991 --> 00:14:33,991
Nothing's happening.

129
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:45,192
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

130
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,392
...men and orcs.

131
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:49,891
What are you going to do, then?

132
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,292
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

133
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,492
And if that does not shatter them...

134
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,393
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

135
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:00,993
...I will try to find the opening words.

136
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,404
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

137
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,904
[Quenya] <i>...a lasta quettanya...</i>
[English] ...listen to my word...

138
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:13,004
[Quenya] <i>...fenda casarinwa!</i>
[English] ...threshold of dwarves!

139
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:16,394
Mines are no place for a pony.

140
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:20,594
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

141
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:21,994
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

142
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:24,695
Go on, Bill. Go on.

143
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:28,896
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

144
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:38,196
Do not disturb the water.

145
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,397
Oh, it's useless.

146
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:55,198
It's a riddle.

147
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,098
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

148
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,399
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

149
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:05,798
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

150
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,099
Mellon.

151
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:29,901
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

152
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:36,002
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

153
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:40,702
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

154
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,601
And they call it a mine.

155
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,703
A mine!

156
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:50,003
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

157
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:57,804
No....

158
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:00,704
No!

159
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:04,904
Goblins.

160
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:13,005
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

161
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,705
Now, get out of here. Get out!

162
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,906
- Frodo!
- Help!

163
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:23,805
Strider!

164
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:26,606
- Help!
- Get off him!

165
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:27,906
Aragorn!

166
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:39,407
Frodo!

167
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,809
Into the mines!

168
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,110
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

169
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,211
Run!

170
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,712
We now have but one choice.

171
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:41,613
We must face the long dark of Moria.

172
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,013
Be on your guard.

173
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,613
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

174
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:51,314
...in the deep places of the world.

175
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:03,115
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

176
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:07,215
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

177
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,720
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

178
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,419
...or jewels...

179
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,620
...but mithril.

180
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:25,722
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

181
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:30,022
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

182
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:32,123
I never told him...

183
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:37,123
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

184
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,325
Pippin.

185
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:14,527
I have no memory of this place.

186
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,127
- Are we Lost?
- No.

187
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,827
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

188
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:22,527
- Merry?
- What?

189
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,628
I'm hungry.

190
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:40,329
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

191
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:44,629
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

192
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:49,130
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

193
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,530
...or was set loose.

194
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,630
Now the ring has brought him here.

195
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,031
He will never be rid of his need for it.

196
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:06,831
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

197
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:11,932
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

198
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:18,032
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

199
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,933
Before it drove him mad.

200
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:25,033
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

201
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,433
Pity?

202
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:30,434
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

203
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:36,434
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

204
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,534
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

205
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:46,835
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

206
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:49,935
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

207
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:56,336
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

208
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:00,136
...before this is over.

209
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:05,437
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

210
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:15,538
I wish the ring had never come to me.

211
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,037
I wish none of this had happened.

212
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,038
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

213
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:30,439
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

214
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:35,939
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

215
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,940
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

216
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,640
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

217
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
And that is an encouraging thought.

218
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,941
It's that way.

219
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:56,441
- He's remembered.
- No.

220
00:23:56,741 --> 00:24:00,342
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

221
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:05,642
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

222
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:24,744
Let me risk a little more light.

223
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:31,544
Behold...

224
00:24:32,044 --> 00:24:37,145
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

225
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:43,045
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

226
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,848
Gimli!

227
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,849
No!

228
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:24,549
Oh, no.

229
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:27,649
No.

230
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,950
"Here lies Balin...

231
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,451
...son of Fundin...

232
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:42,351
...Lord of Moria."

233
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,051
He is dead, then.

234
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:48,551
It's as I feared.

235
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:09,653
We must move on. We cannot linger.

236
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:14,454
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

237
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,254
We have barred the gates...

238
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,354
...but cannot hold them for long.

239
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:24,355
The ground shakes.

240
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:26,355
Drums...

241
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:30,055
...drums in the deep.

242
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:35,756
We cannot get out.

243
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:41,556
A shadow moves in the dark.

244
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:45,857
We cannot get out.

245
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,757
They are coming."

246
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,761
Fool of a Took!

247
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,761
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

248
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,564
Frodo!

249
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,364
Orcs.

250
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,365
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

251
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,366
They have a cave-troll.

252
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,367
Let them come!

253
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,168
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

254
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,980
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

255
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:18,481
Frodo!

256
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,784
Aragorn! Aragorn!

257
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:56,684
Frodo!

258
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,789
Frodo!

259
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,394
Oh, no.

260
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:55,595
He's alive.

261
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:00,996
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

262
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,396
You should be dead.

263
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:06,096
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

264
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:10,997
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

265
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,097
Mithril.

266
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:23,398
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

267
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,198
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

268
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
This way!

269
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,307
What is this new devilry?

270
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,308
A Balrog.

271
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,709
A demon of the ancient world.

272
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,309
This foe is beyond any of you.

273
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:31,109
Run!

274
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,910
Quickly!

275
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:57,912
Gandalf.

276
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,012
Lead them on, Aragorn.

277
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,012
The bridge is near.

278
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:10,013
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

279
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,915
Gandalf!

280
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:00,517
Merry! Pippin!

281
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:13,118
Sam!

282
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,019
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

283
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,619
Not the beard!

284
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,821
Steady.

285
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,421
Hold on!

286
00:39:03,623 --> 00:39:04,823
Hang on!

287
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:17,224
Lean forward!

288
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:21,224
Steady.

289
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:23,725
Come on!

290
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:25,425
Now!

291
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,327
Over the bridge!

292
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,127
Fly!

293
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,831
You cannot pass!

294
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,731
Gandalf!

295
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:43,732
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

296
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,532
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

297
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,633
Go back to the Shadow.

298
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:12,735
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

299
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:43,737
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

300
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,938
Fly, you fools!

301
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,239
No!

302
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:08,540
Aragorn!

303
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,745
Legolas, get them up.

304
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:14,645
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

305
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:18,446
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

306
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,946
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

307
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:26,247
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

308
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,047
On your feet, Sam.

309
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:31,847
Frodo?

310
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,547
Frodo!

Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

327
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:18,357
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

Speak words we can all understand!

336
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,860
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

337
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,660

Nor would he have you give up hope.

350

You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

351
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:16,067
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

366
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:32,479
Gandalf the Grey did not pass

What now becomes of this fellowship?

379
00:50:43,286 --> 00:50:46,086
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

380
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:52,386
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

381
00:50:52,387 --> 00:50:55,487
Stray but a little and it will fail...

382

01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,752
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

506
01:02:56,152 --> 01:02:58,552
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

507
01:02:58,852 --> 01:03:02,552
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

508
01:03:02,952 --> 01:03:07,753
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

509
01:03:16,184 --> 01:03:18,328
[Sindarin] <i>Le aphadar aen.</i>
[English] You are being tracked.

510
01:03:20,654 --> 01:03:25,054
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

511
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:47,156
<i>My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.</i>

512
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:50,857
<i>Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.</i>

513
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,857
<i>These are the daggers of the Noldorin.</i>

514
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:02,958
<i>They have already seen service in war.</i>

515
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:05,458
<i>Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.</i>

516
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,858
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

517
01:04:10,859 --> 01:04:12,858
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

518
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:15,758
<i>...Elven rope made of hithlain.</i>

519
01:04:15,759 --> 01:04:17,959
Thank you, my lady.

520
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:23,060
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

521
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,460
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

522
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:34,961
Nothing.

523
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:38,861
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

524
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:44,562
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

525
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,262
Actually....

526
01:04:53,562 --> 01:04:55,163
There was one thing.

527
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,563
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossible.

528
01:04:58,863 --> 01:05:01,563
Stupid to ask.

529
01:05:04,263 --> 01:05:06,263
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

530
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:09,964
<i>...than the gift you already bear.</i>

531
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:11,710
[Sindarin] <i>Am meleth dîn...</i>
[English] For her love...

532
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:18,242
[Sindarin] <i>...I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.</i>
[English] ...the gift of life of Arwen will fade.

533
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:21,230
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e broniatha...</i>
[English] I wish that she endures...

534
01:05:21,956 --> 01:05:26,276
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>
[English] ...even if we separate beyond the limits of this world.

535
01:05:28,979 --> 01:05:34,992
[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

536
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:38,366
That choice is yet before her.

537
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:42,067
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

538
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:47,967
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

539
01:05:48,467 --> 01:05:52,668
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

540
01:05:59,753 --> 01:06:00,788
[Quenya] <i>Namárië.</i>
[English] Farewell.

541
01:06:05,068 --> 01:06:07,946
[Sindarin] <i>Nadath nâ i moe cerich...</i>
[English] There is much you have yet to do...

542
01:06:10,453 --> 01:06:11,746
[Sindarin] <i>...dan...</i>
[English] ...but...

543
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,890
[Sindarin] <i>...ú-'eveditham, Elessar.</i>
[English] ...we shall not meet again, Elessar.

544
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,569
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

545
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:27,071
<i>I give you the light of Earendil...</i>

546
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,271
<i>...our most beloved star.</i>

547
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:43,672
<i>May it be a light for you in dark places...</i>

548
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:48,073
<i>... when all other lights go out.</i>

549
01:06:57,174 --> 01:07:00,174
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

550
01:07:00,974 --> 01:07:04,974
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

551
01:07:05,974 --> 01:07:09,175
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

552
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:11,475
What was her gift?

553
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:16,475
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

554
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,176
She gave me three.

555
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:05,785
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

556
01:09:09,685 --> 01:09:12,586
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

557
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:15,986
But he's too clever a waterman.

558
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,185
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

559
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:22,487
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

560
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:24,787
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

561
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:28,087
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

562
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:31,387
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

563
01:09:32,387 --> 01:09:35,288
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

564
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,688
But you're not.

565
01:09:37,088 --> 01:09:39,587
I'm here to help you.

566
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:41,388
I promised Gandalf that I would.

567
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:49,989
You can't help me, Sam.

568
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:53,989
Not this time.

569
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,990
Get some sleep.

570
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,491
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

571
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,691
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

572
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:13,591
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

573
01:10:13,991 --> 01:10:16,691
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

574
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:19,292
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

575
01:10:21,192 --> 01:10:23,991
Have you so little faith in your own people?

576
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:26,992
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

577
01:10:27,392 --> 01:10:30,593
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

578
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,993
But you will not see that.

579
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:34,793
You are afraid!

580
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:37,593
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

581
01:10:37,993 --> 01:10:41,294
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

582
01:10:43,894 --> 01:10:48,094
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

583
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,395
Frodo.

584
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,696
The Argonath.

We cross the lake at nightfall.

590
01:12:36,104 --> 01:12:38,504
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

591
01:12:38,804 --> 01:12:42,105
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

592
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:46,405
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

593
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:49,805
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

594
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:53,106
And after that, it gets even better.

595
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:58,306
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

596
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:00,106
That is our road.

597
01:13:01,706 --> 01:13:04,807
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

598
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:06,707
Recover my...

599
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:11,707
- We should Leave now.
- No.

600
01:13:12,007 --> 01:13:16,208
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

601
01:13:16,608 --> 01:13:20,008
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

602
01:13:20,308 --> 01:13:24,108
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

603
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:28,809
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

604
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:35,709
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

605
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:38,110
Where's Frodo?

606
01:14:03,812 --> 01:14:05,712
None of us should wander alone.

607
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:09,112
You, least of all.

608
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:11,713
So much depends on you.

609
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:14,813
Frodo?

610
01:14:22,014 --> 01:14:24,514
I know why you seek solitude.

611
01:14:25,314 --> 01:14:28,614
You suffer. I see it day by day.

612
01:14:29,514 --> 01:14:32,514
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

613
01:14:34,215 --> 01:14:36,815
There are other ways, Frodo.

614
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:40,815
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

615
01:14:41,115 --> 01:14:44,716
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

616
01:14:45,116 --> 01:14:48,116
Warning...against what?

617
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,416
We're all afraid, Frodo.

618
01:14:50,716 --> 01:14:54,216
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

619
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:58,217
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

620
01:15:00,217 --> 01:15:03,317
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

621
01:15:05,117 --> 01:15:07,018
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

622
01:15:08,318 --> 01:15:11,818
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

623
01:15:13,918 --> 01:15:17,018
What chance do you think you have?

624
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:21,819
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

625
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:25,819
And you will beg for death before the end!

626
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,119
You fool!

627
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,220
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

628
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,220
It should be mine! Give it to me!

629
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,720
- Give it to me!
- No!

630
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,821
- Give it to me!
- No.

631
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:50,422
I see your mind.

632
01:15:50,822 --> 01:15:53,622
You will take the ring to Sauron!

633
01:15:53,922 --> 01:15:55,722
You will betray us!

634
01:15:56,022 --> 01:15:59,122
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

635
01:15:59,622 --> 01:16:03,123
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:27,846
Run, Frodo. Go!

674
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:31,447
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

675
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:33,547
- Over here!
- This way!

676
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,748
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

677
01:21:42,153 --> 01:21:45,053
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

678
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:29,357
Run!

679
01:26:01,076 --> 01:26:02,577
No.

680
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:09,577
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

681
01:26:09,877 --> 01:26:11,877
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

682
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:15,278
I let Frodo go.

683
01:26:15,978 --> 01:26:18,478
Then you did what I could not.

684
01:26:19,578 --> 01:26:22,778
I tried to take the ring from him.

685
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:27,479
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

686
01:26:27,879 --> 01:26:30,079
I did not see it.

687
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:33,479
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

688
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:36,480
You fought bravely.

689
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,380
You have kept your honor.

690
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,880
Leave it.

691
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,380
It is over.

692
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:50,781
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

693
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:54,181
...and my city to ruin.

694
01:26:58,382 --> 01:27:01,081
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

695
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:05,182
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

696
01:27:06,282 --> 01:27:08,683
...nor our people fail.

697
01:27:09,683 --> 01:27:11,083
Our people.

698
01:27:14,983 --> 01:27:16,983
Our people.

699
01:27:38,785 --> 01:27:41,686
I would have followed you, my brother.

700
01:27:43,386 --> 01:27:45,286
My captain.

701
01:27:48,086 --> 01:27:49,886
My king.

702
01:28:09,588 --> 01:28:11,688
Be at peace...

703
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,088
...son of Gondor.

704
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:33,790
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

705
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:37,391
But he will not return.

706
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,693
Frodo!

707
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:25,395
<i>I wish the ring had never come to me.</i>

708
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,495
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

709
01:29:32,695 --> 01:29:35,396
<i>So do all who live to see such times...</i>

710
01:29:35,696 --> 01:29:38,996
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

711
01:29:39,396 --> 01:29:41,896
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

712
01:29:42,196 --> 01:29:46,797
<i>...is what to do with the time that is given to you.</i>

713
01:30:15,699 --> 01:30:17,700
Frodo, no!

714
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,700
Frodo!

715
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,000
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

716
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,601
Go back, Sam!

717
01:30:29,201 --> 01:30:32,601
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

718
01:30:32,901 --> 01:30:35,601
And I'm coming with you!

719
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:38,601
You can't swim!

720
01:30:42,402 --> 01:30:44,102
Sam!

721
01:30:49,702 --> 01:30:51,103
Sam!

722
01:31:32,006 --> 01:31:34,706
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

723
01:31:35,107 --> 01:31:39,207
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

724
01:31:40,507 --> 01:31:43,007
And I don't mean to.

725
01:31:43,407 --> 01:31:45,507
I don't mean to.

726
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:49,008
Oh Sam.

727
01:32:04,009 --> 01:32:05,609
Come on.

728
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:38,412
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

729
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:58,414
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

730
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:06,615
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

731
01:33:18,616 --> 01:33:21,716
Not if we hold true to each other.

732
01:33:23,216 --> 01:33:27,517
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

733
01:33:28,617 --> 01:33:33,717
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

734
01:33:35,217 --> 01:33:37,117
We travel light.

735
01:33:37,418 --> 01:33:39,318
Let us hunt some orc.

736
01:33:42,318 --> 01:33:44,318
Yes!

737
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,720
Mordor.

738
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:08,620
I hope the others find a safer road.

739
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:12,221
Strider will look after them.

740
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:16,521
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

741
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:19,320
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

742
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:21,021
We may.

743
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:24,322
Sam...

744
01:34:27,922 --> 01:34:30,422
...I'm glad you are with me.
