[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned 'wilith.</i>

14
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:47,002
I smell it in the air.

15
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:49,302
Much that once was...

16
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:51,102
...is lost.

17
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:54,801
For none now live who remember it.

18
00:00:54,802 --> 00:01:02,302
The Lord of the Rings.

19
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:12,003
It began with the forging of the great rings.

20
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:14,203
Three were given to the elves:

21
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:18,103
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

22
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:21,902
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

23
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:26,403
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

24
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,203
And nine...

25
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:31,304
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

26
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:35,404
...who, above all else, desire power.

27
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:41,604
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

28
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,404
But they were all of them deceived.

29
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,804
For another ring was made.

30
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:53,104
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

31
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:58,005
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

32
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,305
... to control all others.

33
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:04,405
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

34
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:08,805
...and his will to dominate all life.

35
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,705
One ring to rule them all.

36
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,304
One by one...

37
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:21,005
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

38
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:24,306
But there were some who resisted.

39
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:29,406
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

40
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:34,306
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

52
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,508
...could not be undone.

56
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:42,609
It was in this moment...

57
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,209
... when all hope had faded...

58
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,409
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

59
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:26,910
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

60
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:36,211
The ring passed to Isildur...

61
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:40,511
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

62
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,411
But the hearts of men...

63
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,111
...are easily corrupted.

64
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:50,911
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

65
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:18,812
It betrayed Isildur...

66
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:23,113
... to his death.

67
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:31,113
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

68
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,613
...were lost.

69
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:36,713
History became legend...

70
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:38,913
...legend became myth.

71
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,913
And for two and a half thousand years...

72
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:45,913
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

73
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,314
Until, when chance came...

74
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:53,114
...it ensnared a new bearer.

75
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:59,214
My precious.

76
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:02,114
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

77
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:06,114
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

78
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:09,414
And there it consumed him.

79
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:11,614
It came to me.

80
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:16,215
My own. My love. My own.

81
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:21,115
My precious.

82
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:28,215
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

83
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:32,215
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

84
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:36,915
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

85
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,516
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

86
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,616
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

87
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,616
... whispers of a nameless fear.

88
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,116
And the ring of power perceived...

89
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:53,116
...its time had now come.

90
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,216
It abandoned Gollum.

91
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:03,217
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

92
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:08,717
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

93
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,117
What's this?

94
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:11,816
A hobbit.

95
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,617
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

96
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,716
A ring.

97
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,717
Lost!

98
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,116
The 22nd day of September...

99
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:24,817
My precious is lost!

100
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:27,417
For the time will soon come...

101
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:32,718
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

102
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,018
...in the year 1400...

103
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,617
...by Shire-reckoning.

104
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:52,418
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

105
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,719
...the Shire...

106
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,719
...Middle-earth.

107
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,619
The third age of this world.

108
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:13,019
The Fellowship of the Ring.

109
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,919
There and back again.

110
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,620
A Hobbit's tale.

111
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,720
By Bilbo Baggins.

112
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,220
Now...

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,020
...where to begin?

114
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Ah, yes....

115
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,721
"Concerning...

116
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,421
...Hobbits."

117
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:53,021
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

118
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:55,320
...for many hundreds of years...

119
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,620
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

120
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,721
...by the world of the big folk.

121
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:07,621
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

122
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:11,121
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

123
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:15,222
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

124
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,622
...nor counted among the very wise.

125
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:27,022
Frodo! Someone at the door.

126
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,822
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

127
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:35,322
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

128
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:38,023
A rather unfair observation...

129
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:41,723
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

130
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:45,023
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

131
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,323
But where our hearts truly lie...

132
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,623
...is in peace and quiet...

133
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,523
...and good, tilled earth.

134
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:58,823
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

135
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:06,324
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

136
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:11,724
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

137
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:18,224
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

138
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:25,724
Frodo, the door!

139
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,524
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

140
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:33,425
Frodo!

141
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:42,625
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

142
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,225
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

143
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:56,426
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

144
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:59,926
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

145
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:05,126
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

146
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:09,626
<i>And I must follow if I can
- You're late.</i>

147
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:16,726
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

148
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:22,127
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

149
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,527
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

150
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:44,127
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

151
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:48,028
How is the old rascal?

152
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:52,128
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

153
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,728
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

154
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,927
Well, that should please him.

155
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,928
Half the Shire's been invited.

156
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,828
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

157
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:08,228
And so life in the Shire goes on...

158
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,529
... very much as it has this past age.

159
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:17,129
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

160
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,329
If it comes at all.

161
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:24,029
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

162
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,629
...passing from one generation to the next.

163
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:33,029
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

164
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:34,729
...in Bag End.

165
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,230
And there always will be.

166
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,230
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

167
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,830
I mean, more than usual.

168
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,730
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

169
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,430
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

170
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,931
Where's it gone?

171
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:39,732
He's up to something.

172
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,332
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

173
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,232
But I know you have something to do with it.

174
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,633
Good gracious me.

175
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,733
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

176
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:57,933
Indeed.

177
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,433
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

178
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:06,733
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

179
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,633
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

180
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,933
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

181
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,333
Oh, really?

182
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:24,934
Gandalf! Gandalf!

183
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,334
Fireworks, Gandalf!

184
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,934
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

185
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:57,935
Gandalf?

186
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:02,435
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

187
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:08,835
So am I.

188
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,136
No, thank you!

189
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:46,037
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

190
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:49,837
And what about very old friends?

191
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,837
Gandalf?

192
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,837
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

193
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:04,138
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

194
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:08,038
You haven't aged a day.

195
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,638
Come on, come in!

196
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:19,238
Welcome, welcome.

197
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,938
Oh, here we are.

198
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:27,137
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

199
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:31,039
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

200
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:35,139
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

201
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:40,839
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

202
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,739
Just tea, thank you.

203
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,839
I was expecting you sometime last week.

204
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,340
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

205
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,640
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

206
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

207
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,440
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

208
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,140
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

209
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,140
I've just found some sponge cake.

210
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,441
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

211
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,941
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

212
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,241
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

213
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,341
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

214
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,141
I'm not at home!

215
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,741
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

216
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,042
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

217
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:49,142
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

218
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:52,141
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

219
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:54,242
...never giving me a moment's peace.

220
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,542
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

221
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:03,242
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

222
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,342
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

223
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:09,843
All the arrangements are made.

224
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:13,443
Oh, thank you.

225
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:16,243
Frodo suspects something.

226
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,943
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

227
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,743
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

228
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:25,143
You will tell him, won't you?

229
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:28,043
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

230
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,843
I know.

231
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:37,544
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

232
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:41,444
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

233
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,444
The woods, the fields.

234
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:47,944
Little rivers.

235
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:55,144
I am old, Gandalf.

236
00:18:56,644 --> 00:19:01,645
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

237
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,544
I feel thin.

238
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,445
Sort of stretched...

239
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,945
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

240
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:17,645
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

241
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:21,045
And I don't expect I shall return.

242
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,545
In fact, I mean not to.

243
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:33,146
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

244
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,246
Gandalf, my old friend...

245
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:56,147
...this will be a night to remember.

246
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,148
Hello, hello.

247
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:24,348
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

248
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,948
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

249
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,048
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

250
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:37,048
Go on!

251
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:48,949
So there I was...

252
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,249
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

253
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,448
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

254
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,949
...about how they were going to cook us.

255
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:03,149
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

256
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,749
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

257
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:11,550
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

258
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,050
...and turned them all to stone!

259
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,850
Quickly.

260
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,050
Up they go!

261
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,250
No no, the big one - big one

262
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,150
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

263
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:46,250
Are all these children yours?

264
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:49,351
Good gracious, you have been productive.

265
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:52,751
Bilbo?

266
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,151
Sackville-Bagginses!

267
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,451
Quickly, hide!

268
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,552
Thank you, my boy.

269
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:13,352
You're a good lad, Frodo.

270
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:17,452
I'm very selfish, you know.

271
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:21,352
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

272
00:22:21,852 --> 00:22:23,952
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

273
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:25,652
...but it wasn't out of charity.

274
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,652
I think it was because...

275
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:30,053
...of all my numerous relations...

276
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:33,853
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

277
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,053
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

278
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:37,953
No.

279
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,753
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

280
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:44,253
The point is, Frodo...

281
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,353
...you'll be all right.

282
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,754
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

283
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,553
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

284
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,254
This was your idea.

285
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:15,654
Bilbo.

286
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,455
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

287
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:23,055
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

288
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:40,055
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

289
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:45,856
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

290
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,056
I might've known.

291
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,056
Speech, Bilbo!

292
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,355
Speech!

293
00:23:58,356 --> 00:23:59,556
Speech!

294
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:07,056
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

295
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,957
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

296
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,657
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

297
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:13,957
...Hornblowers...

298
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:16,757
...Bolgers...

299
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,757
...Bracegirdles...

300
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,557
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

301
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:26,857
Today is my 111th birthday!

302
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,256
Happy birthday!

303
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:34,558
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

304
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,758
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

305
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:41,458
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

306
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:46,158
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

307
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,558
I have things to do.

308
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,059
I've put this off for far too long.

309
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,859
I regret to announce this is the end!

310
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,259
I'm going now.

311
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,259
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

312
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:24,859
Goodbye.

313
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:01,161
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

314
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,761
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

315
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:07,860
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

316
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:10,160
...and none of them should be used lightly.

317
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,361
It was just a bit of fun.

318
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:16,261
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

319
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:21,162
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

320
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:24,062
As often as I can spare them.

321
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:27,462
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

322
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:30,962
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

323
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:35,462
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

324
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,562
No. Wait, it's...

325
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:44,763
...here in my pocket.

326
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:52,563
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

327
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,763
Yet, after all, why not?

328
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:04,063
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

329
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:06,763
Is that so hard?

330
00:27:07,063 --> 00:27:08,364
Well, no.

331
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:12,264
And yes.

332
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:17,264
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

333
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,364
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

334
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:23,664
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

335
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:25,864
It's mine.

336
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,764
My own.

337
00:27:30,164 --> 00:27:33,965
- My precious.
- Precious?

338
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:37,065
It's been called that before, but not by you.

339
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,865
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

340
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,865
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

341
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,865
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

342
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,265
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

343
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:54,165
I am not trying to rob you.

344
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:00,966
I'm trying to help you.

345
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:12,666
All your long years, we've been friends.

346
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,266
Trust me as you once did.

347
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,966
Let it go.

348
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,466
You're right, Gandalf.

349
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:27,267
The ring must go to Frodo.

350
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:31,667
It's late. The road is long.

351
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,367
Yes, it is time.

352
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:41,967
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

353
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:19,869
I've thought up an ending for my book:

354
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:26,369
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

355
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:30,169
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

356
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,669
Goodbye, Gandalf.

357
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:37,969
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

358
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,970
<i>The road goes ever on and on...</i>

359
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,070
Until our next meeting.

360
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:25,971
It's mine. My own.

361
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:29,671
My precious.

362
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:32,771
Riddles in the dark.

363
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:34,571
Bilbo!

364
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:36,172
Bilbo!

365
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,872
My precious.

366
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:46,572
Precious.

367
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:49,272
He's gone, hasn't he?

368
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:55,172
He talked for so long about leaving...

369
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:58,072
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

370
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,573
Gandalf?

371
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,473
Bilbo's ring.

372
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,173
He's gone to stay with the elves.

373
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:20,373
He's left you Bag End.

374
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,673
Along with all his possessions.

375
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:29,674
The ring is yours now.

376
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:35,773
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

377
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,174
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

378
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:42,574
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

379
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,174
I don't understand.

380
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,575
Neither do I.

381
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,174
Keep it secret.

382
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,175
Keep it safe.

383
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,276
Shire!

384
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:37,694
Baggins!

385
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:47,437
{\an8} [Adûnaic] ♫ <i>Nêbâbîtham Magânanê.</i> ♫
{\an8} [English] ♫ We renounce our Creator. ♫

386
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,078
"The year 3434 of the second age.

387
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:34,579
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

388
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:38,579
...and the finding of the ring of power."

389
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:43,979
"It has come to me.

390
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,579
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

391
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,179
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

392
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:55,179
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

393
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,979
It is precious to me...

394
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,480
...though I buy it with great pain.

395
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,680
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

396
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,680
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

397
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,980
A secret now that only fire can tell."

398
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,680
Shire...

399
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:39,781
...Baggins.

400
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:44,281
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

401
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:47,481
That way.

402
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:53,381
<i>"Hey ho to the dock I go</i>

403
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,781
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

404
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:58,281
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

405
00:34:58,282 --> 00:35:00,382
<i>But there still be...</i>

406
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,982
<i>...many miles to go</i>

407
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:04,182
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

408
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:06,482
<i>And the stream that falls from hill to plain</i>

409
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,582
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

410
00:35:08,882 --> 00:35:11,182
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"</i>

411
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:17,383
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

412
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:21,583
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

413
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,683
War is brewing.

414
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,083
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

415
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:30,082
Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is.

416
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:34,682
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

417
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:37,683
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

418
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,482
And proud of it.

419
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,083
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

420
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:46,084
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

421
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:50,484
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

422
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:56,183
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

423
00:35:56,184 --> 00:36:00,784
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

424
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:03,384
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

425
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:07,985
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

426
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,285
Does she?

427
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:13,885
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

428
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:41,186
Is it secret? Is it safe?

429
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:52,186
What are you doing?

430
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,387
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

431
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:08,787
It's quite cool.

432
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:13,987
What can you see?

433
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,187
Can you see anything?

434
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:22,387
Nothing.

435
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,888
There's nothing.

436
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,588
Wait.

437
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:33,888
There are markings.

438
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:38,788
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

439
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,488
There are few who can.

440
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:46,788
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

441
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,688
Mordor!

442
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:50,889
In the common tongue, it says:

443
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:54,589
"One ring to rule them all...

444
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:57,189
...One ring to find them...

445
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,589
...One ring to bring them all...

446
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,889
...and in the darkness bind them."

447
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:06,588
This is the One ring...

448
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:11,889
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

449
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:16,190
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

450
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,590
Bilbo found it.

451
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,990
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

452
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,690
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

453
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,290
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

454
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,290
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

455
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,990
The ring has awoken.

456
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,891
It's heard its master's call.

457
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:44,891
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

458
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,791
No, Frodo.

459
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:57,091
The spirit of Sauron endured.

460
00:38:57,391 --> 00:39:02,491
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

461
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:05,091
Sauron has returned.

462
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:08,092
His orcs have multiplied.

463
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:12,292
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

464
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:17,192
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

465
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:19,592
He is seeking it.

466
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:23,492
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

467
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:26,592
For the ring yearns above all else...

468
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:30,192
...to return to the hand of its master.

469
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:32,292
They are one...

470
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:35,393
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

471
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:36,793
Frodo...

472
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,093
...he must never find it.

473
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:40,393
All right.

474
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:44,993
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

475
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,893
No one knows it's here, do they?

476
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:54,793
Do they, Gandalf?

477
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,194
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

478
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:03,394
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

479
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,794
But the enemy found him first.

480
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:10,094
I don't know how long they tortured him.

481
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:14,694
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

482
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:17,094
Shire!

483
00:40:17,394 --> 00:40:18,894
Baggins!

484
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:20,993
Shire.

485
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:23,895
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

486
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:27,895
Who goes there?

487
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:30,895
Take it, Gandalf!

488
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,394
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

489
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:34,795
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

490
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:38,295
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

491
00:40:39,995 --> 00:40:42,095
I dare not take it.

492
00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:44,895
Not even to keep it safe.

493
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,095
Understand, Frodo...

494
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:52,296
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

495
00:40:57,796 --> 00:41:03,296
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

496
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:06,996
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

497
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,496
No, it can't.

498
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:17,297
What must I do?

499
00:41:18,997 --> 00:41:22,297
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

500
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,897
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

501
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:27,297
Bree.

502
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:30,197
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

503
00:41:30,497 --> 00:41:32,897
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

504
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:36,797
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

505
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:38,997
I don't have any answers.

506
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:45,898
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

507
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,398
He'll know what to do.

508
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:51,798
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

509
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:54,598
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

510
00:41:55,298 --> 00:41:58,498
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

511
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:02,398
I can cut across country easily enough.

512
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:06,299
My dear Frodo.

513
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,598
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

514
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,599
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

515
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,199
And yet, after a hundred years...

516
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,399
...they can still surprise you.

517
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,499
Get down.

518
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,000
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

519
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,800
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

520
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,700
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

521
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,400
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

522
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,499
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

523
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,800
Nothing important.

524
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,799
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

525
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,499
...and something about the end of the world but...

526
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,201
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

527
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,701
No?

528
00:43:01,001 --> 00:43:02,101
Perhaps not.

529
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:06,701
I've thought of a better use for you.

530
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,401
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

531
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:15,201
Be careful, both of you.

532
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,201
The enemy has many spies in his service:

533
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:21,301
Birds, beasts.

534
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,002
Is it safe?

535
00:43:26,702 --> 00:43:28,002
Never put it on...

536
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,601
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

537
00:43:31,602 --> 00:43:33,302
Always remember, Frodo...

538
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,902
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

539
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:39,502
It wants to be found.

540
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,204
This is it.

541
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,704
This is what?

542
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:27,104
If I take one more step...

543
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:31,404
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

544
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:37,304
Come on, Sam.

545
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:47,605
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

546
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:51,805
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

547
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:56,405
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

548
00:44:56,705 --> 00:45:00,705
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

...it makes me sad.

Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

Just shut your eyes...

565
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:05,808
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

566
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:10,008

567
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:22,007
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

568
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:25,009
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

569
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,709
Me neither, Sam.

570
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:01,310
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

571
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,209
The hour grows late.

572
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,810
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

573
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,610
...seeking my counsel.

574
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,711
For that is why you have come, is it not?

575
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,211
My old friend.

576
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:17,111
Saruman.

577
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:24,911
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

578
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:28,011
So the ring of power has been found.

579
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:31,311
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

580
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:34,811
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

581
00:47:35,511 --> 00:47:39,712
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

582
00:47:40,612 --> 00:47:44,612
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

583
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:46,412
Time?

584
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:50,012
What time do you think we have?

585
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:54,212
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

586
00:47:54,612 --> 00:47:56,712
He cannot yet take physical form...

587
00:47:57,012 --> 00:47:59,612
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

588
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:05,213
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

589
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:11,713
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

590
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:16,513
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

591
00:48:17,513 --> 00:48:22,513
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

592
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:25,413
The eye of Sauron.

593
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:28,213
He is gathering all evil to him.

594
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,414
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

595
00:48:30,714 --> 00:48:33,514
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

596
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:36,214
You know this?

597
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,314
How?

598
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,514
I have seen it.

599
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:44,114
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

600
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:46,414
Why?

601
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:49,514
Why should we fear to use it?

602
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:56,115
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

603
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:59,515
We do not know who else may be watching.

604
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:04,914
The hour is later than you think.

605
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:07,415
Sauron's forces are already moving.

606
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:12,415
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

607
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:13,814
The Nine?

608
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:16,915
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

609
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:19,915
...disguised as riders in black.

610
00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:24,016
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

611
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:27,916
And kill the one who carries it.

612
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,816
Frodo!

613
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:46,816
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

614
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:50,417
There are none who can.

615
00:49:53,017 --> 00:49:55,617
Against the power of Mordor...

616
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:58,517
...there can be no victory.

617
00:50:00,617 --> 00:50:03,617
We must join with him, Gandalf.

618
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:07,217
We must join with Sauron.

619
00:50:10,017 --> 00:50:12,517
It would be wise, my friend.

620
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,617
Tell me...

621
00:50:14,618 --> 00:50:16,318
...friend...

622
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:21,218
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

623
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:02,519
I gave you the chance of...

624
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:06,320
...aiding me willingly...

625
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,620
...but you have elected the way of pain!

626
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:35,521
Mr. Frodo?

627
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:37,921
Frodo? Frodo!

628
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:42,520
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

629
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:45,621
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

630
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:50,321
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

631
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:54,321
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

632
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,322
Frodo.

633
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:00,822
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

634
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:02,422
Get off him.

635
00:52:03,022 --> 00:52:04,421
Come on, Frodo.

636
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:06,422
What's the meaning of this?

637
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:09,922
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

638
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:13,322
You get back here!

639
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:15,622
Get out of my field!

640
00:52:15,922 --> 00:52:18,522
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

641
00:52:18,922 --> 00:52:21,723
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

642
00:52:22,023 --> 00:52:23,122
And some cabbages.

643
00:52:23,123 --> 00:52:26,222
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

644
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:30,323
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

645
00:52:30,723 --> 00:52:32,823
...he's clearly overreacting.

646
00:52:33,123 --> 00:52:34,523
Run!

647
00:52:48,024 --> 00:52:50,524
Oh, that was close.

648
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:54,724
I think I've broken something.

649
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:58,123
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

650
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:01,824
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

651
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,424
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

652
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:14,625
That's mine.

653
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:19,025
That's nice, Merry.

654
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,624
Here's a nice one, Sam.

655
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,225
I think we should get off the road.

656
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,924
Get off the road!

657
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:36,525
Quick!

658
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,726
Be quiet!

659
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:59,229
What was that?

660
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,430
Anything?

661
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,630
Nothing.

662
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,630
What is going on?

663
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:42,830
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

664
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,730
Frodo?

665
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:47,531
Get down!

666
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,631
I have to leave the Shire.

667
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,030
Sam and I must get to Bree.

668
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:11,631
Right.

669
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:15,232
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

670
00:56:23,632 --> 00:56:24,832
Run!

671
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,032
This way! Follow me!

672
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:32,732
Run!

673
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:47,733
Get the rope, Sam!

674
00:56:50,433 --> 00:56:51,933
Frodo!

675
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:54,033
Run, Frodo!

676
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:55,532
Go!
- Hurry!

677
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:58,233
Frodo, come on!

678
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,333
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

679
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:20,334
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

680
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:36,635
Come on.

681
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:51,135
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

682
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:57,535
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

683
00:57:57,536 --> 00:58:01,536
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

684
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:05,236
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

685
00:58:06,436 --> 00:58:08,836
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

686
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:11,536
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

687
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:14,735
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

688
00:58:14,736 --> 00:58:17,036
Can't be too careful.

689
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:40,137
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

690
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:05,838
Excuse me.

691
00:59:06,938 --> 00:59:09,638
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

692
00:59:09,938 --> 00:59:15,739
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

693
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,739
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

694
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:23,939
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

695
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:27,739
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

696
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:31,039
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

697
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:33,239
Gandalf.

698
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,739
Oh, yes...

699
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,040
...I remember. Elderly chap.

700
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,340
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

701
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,540
Not seen him for six months.

702
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,740
What do we do now?

703
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,139
Sam...

704
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
...he'll be here. He'll come.

705
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:07,041
Get out of my way!

706
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:11,140
What's that?

707
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,741
This, my friend, is a pint.

708
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:15,641
It comes in pints?

709
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,541
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

710
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,742
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

711
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:34,942
Excuse me.

712
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,642
That man in the corner. Who is he?

713
01:00:41,042 --> 01:00:45,242
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

714
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:49,942
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

715
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:53,642
Strider.

716
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:09,843
<i>Baggins...</i>

717
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:15,943
<i>Baggins...</i>

718
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,644
<i>Baggins...</i>

719
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:26,344
<i>Baggins...</i>

720
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:29,944
<i>Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.</i>

721
01:01:30,644 --> 01:01:33,243
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

722
01:01:33,244 --> 01:01:36,543
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

723
01:01:36,544 --> 01:01:38,844
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

724
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,144
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

725
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:17,146
<i>You cannot hide.</i>

726
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:23,146
<i>I see you.</i>

727
01:02:25,046 --> 01:02:27,645
<i>There is no life...</i>

728
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:29,946
<i>...in the void.</i>

729
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,646
<i>Only...</i>

730
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:34,146
<i>...death.</i>

731
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:44,847
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

732
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:50,647
What do you want?

733
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:52,947
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

734
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:56,347
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

735
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:59,147
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

736
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:02,948
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

737
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:06,148
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

738
01:03:07,548 --> 01:03:08,447
Yes.

739
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:12,448
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

740
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:18,948
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

741
01:03:20,848 --> 01:03:24,748
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

742
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:27,949
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

743
01:03:28,249 --> 01:03:29,249
They're coming.

They were once men.

Great kings of men.

751
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:04,652
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

752
01:05:05,452 --> 01:05:08,452
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

753
01:05:08,752 --> 01:05:11,953
One by one, falling into darkness.

754
01:05:12,253 --> 01:05:14,653
Now they are slaves to his will.

755
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:18,752
They are the Nazgûl.

756

Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

757

759

They will never stop hunting you.

760
01:05:40,754 --> 01:05:43,554

- Into the wild.

761
01:05:51,954 --> 01:05:55,754
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

762
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:58,954
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

763
01:05:59,354 --> 01:06:03,155
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

764
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:06,655
We have no choice but to trust him.

765
01:06:06,955 --> 01:06:10,155
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

766
01:06:12,655 --> 01:06:15,855
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

767

We're going to see the elves.

- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

769

- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

770

What about second breakfast?

771
01:06:53,857 --> 01:06:56,857
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

772
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:02,357
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

773

Frodo.

- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

898
01:24:33,498 --> 01:24:36,398
And you're lucky to be here too.

899

01:24:56,499 --> 01:25:01,799
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

903
01:25:06,599 --> 01:25:08,299
I was delayed.

904
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:13,399
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

905
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:22,200
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

906
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,300

907
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,400
...or embrace your own destruction!

908
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,500
There is only one lord of the ring.

909
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,800
Only one who can bend it to his will.

910
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,601
And he does not share power.

911
01:25:58,001 --> 01:26:01,201

01:26:11,502 --> 01:26:15,102
Gandalf? What is it?

913
01:26:16,302 --> 01:26:18,002
Nothing, Frodo.

914
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:20,602
Frodo!

915
01:26:22,002 --> 01:26:24,202
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

916
01:26:24,602 --> 01:26:27,202
Sam has hardly left your side.

917
01:26:27,602 --> 01:26:29,602
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

918
01:26:30,202 --> 01:26:35,103
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

919
01:26:36,703 --> 01:26:40,203
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

920
01:27:28,405 --> 01:27:31,505
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

921
01:27:31,905 --> 01:27:33,605
Bilbo.

922
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:40,504
There and back again

923
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,205
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

924
01:27:46,405 --> 01:27:49,806
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

925
01:27:50,206 --> 01:27:53,906
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

926
01:27:54,506 --> 01:27:56,706
...visit Lake-town...

927
01:27:57,006 --> 01:28:00,306
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

928
01:28:01,006 --> 01:28:05,606
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

929
01:28:18,007 --> 01:28:19,707
I miss the Shire.

930
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:25,107
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

931
01:28:25,607 --> 01:28:29,007
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

932
01:28:32,007 --> 01:28:35,507
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

933
01:28:41,008 --> 01:28:44,008
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

934
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:47,508
My dear boy.

935
01:28:51,808 --> 01:28:55,508
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

936
01:28:56,408 --> 01:28:58,108
No harm in being prepared.

937
01:28:58,408 --> 01:29:00,908
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

938
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,908
- More than anything.
- I did.

939
01:29:04,308 --> 01:29:06,208
It's just....

940
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,509
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

941
01:29:09,809 --> 01:29:13,309
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

942
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:16,909
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

943
01:29:17,209 --> 01:29:18,809
Off home.

944
01:29:23,009 --> 01:29:24,909
You are right, Sam.

945
01:29:27,209 --> 01:29:29,909
We did what we set out to do.

946
01:29:30,509 --> 01:29:33,010
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

947
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:39,510
I am ready to go home.

948
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:42,210
His strength returns.

949
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:48,010
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

950
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:51,309
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

951
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:55,110
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

952
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:58,811
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

953
01:29:59,111 --> 01:30:04,311
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

954
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:09,211
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

955
01:30:09,611 --> 01:30:12,211
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

956
01:30:12,611 --> 01:30:15,711
Our list of allies grows thin.

957
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:19,211
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

958
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:23,011
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

959
01:30:23,412 --> 01:30:25,712
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

960
01:30:26,112 --> 01:30:30,512
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

961
01:30:30,912 --> 01:30:33,212
Saruman is coming for the ring.

962
01:30:33,712 --> 01:30:37,612
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

963
01:30:38,012 --> 01:30:42,212
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

964
01:30:46,212 --> 01:30:47,212
Gandalf...

965
01:30:48,612 --> 01:30:51,013
...the ring cannot stay here.

966
01:31:10,713 --> 01:31:13,813
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

967
01:31:14,113 --> 01:31:16,814
They must decide now how to end it.

968
01:31:17,914 --> 01:31:21,314
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

969
01:31:22,114 --> 01:31:25,614
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

970
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:30,914
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

971
01:31:32,614 --> 01:31:35,414
It is in men that we must place our hope.

972
01:31:35,914 --> 01:31:37,514
Men?

973
01:31:38,514 --> 01:31:41,515
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

974
01:31:41,915 --> 01:31:46,115
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

975
01:31:46,615 --> 01:31:50,015
It is because of men the ring survives.

976
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:51,915
I was there, Gandalf.

977
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:55,415
I was there 3000 years ago...

978
01:32:02,315 --> 01:32:04,615
... when Isildur took the ring.

979
01:32:04,915 --> 01:32:08,616
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

980
01:32:11,316 --> 01:32:13,816
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

981
01:32:15,516 --> 01:32:19,016
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

982
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:22,815
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

983
01:32:22,816 --> 01:32:25,516
Cast it into the fire!

984
01:32:30,816 --> 01:32:34,417
- Destroy it!
- No.

985
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:38,017
Isildur!

986
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:43,117
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

987
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:51,517
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

988
01:32:52,517 --> 01:32:56,117
There's no strength left in the world of men.

989
01:32:56,517 --> 01:33:01,118
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

990
01:33:01,518 --> 01:33:04,718
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

991
01:33:06,618 --> 01:33:10,218
He turned from that path a long time ago.

992
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:12,618
He has chosen exile.

993
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:45,619
You are no elf.

994
01:33:45,919 --> 01:33:47,919
Men of the South are welcome here.

995
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:52,020
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

996
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:56,320
Then we are here on common purpose...

997
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,120
...friend.

998
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,321
The shards of Narsil.

999
01:34:19,921 --> 01:34:24,121
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

1000
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:29,421
It's still sharp.

1001
01:34:38,421 --> 01:34:41,322
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1002
01:35:08,323 --> 01:35:11,323
Why do you fear the past?

1003
01:35:12,223 --> 01:35:17,323
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

1004
01:35:17,823 --> 01:35:21,123
You are not bound to his fate.

1005
01:35:21,723 --> 01:35:25,523
The same blood flows in my veins.

1006
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,224
The same weakness.

1007
01:35:34,024 --> 01:35:36,724
Your time will come.

1008
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:41,224
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

1009
01:35:44,084 --> 01:35:46,794
[Sindarin] <i>A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn.</i>
[English] The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn.

1010
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:51,374
[Sindarin] <i>Ú or le a ú or nin.</i>
[English] Not over you, not over me.

1011
01:36:02,535 --> 01:36:05,775
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i lú i erui govannem?</i>
[English] Do you remember when we first met?

1012
01:36:09,265 --> 01:36:13,295
[Sindarin] <i>Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.</i>
[English] I thought I had strayed into a dream.

1013
01:36:14,195 --> 01:36:16,875
[Sindarin] <i>Gwenwin in enninath.</i>
[English] Long years have passed.

1014
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:21,575
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.</i>
[English] You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

1015
01:36:23,416 --> 01:36:25,716
[Sindarin] <i>Renich i beth i pennen?</i>
[English] Do you remember what I told you?

1016
01:36:31,926 --> 01:36:34,526
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

1017
01:36:36,726 --> 01:36:41,426
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

1018
01:36:42,726 --> 01:36:44,625
And to that I hold.

1019
01:36:44,626 --> 01:36:48,327
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

1020
01:36:48,827 --> 01:36:52,427
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

1021
01:37:01,327 --> 01:37:04,627
I choose a mortal life.

1022
01:37:06,127 --> 01:37:10,227
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

1023
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:16,028
...like my heart.

1024
01:37:31,928 --> 01:37:35,528
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

1025
01:37:35,928 --> 01:37:39,629
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

1026
01:37:40,429 --> 01:37:45,129
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

1027
01:37:45,529 --> 01:37:48,929
You will unite, or you will fall.

1028
01:37:49,329 --> 01:37:53,429
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

1029
01:37:55,429 --> 01:37:58,729
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

1030
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:14,630
So it is true.

1031
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:25,930
<i>The ring of power...</i>

1032
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:29,530
<i>The doom of men...</i>

1033
01:38:32,131 --> 01:38:34,131
In a dream...

1034
01:38:35,931 --> 01:38:39,031
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1035
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,031
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

1036
01:38:41,831 --> 01:38:43,631
A voice was crying:

1037
01:38:43,931 --> 01:38:46,731
"Your doom is near at hand.

1038
01:38:47,931 --> 01:38:50,531
Isildur's bane is found."

1039
01:38:52,661 --> 01:38:54,061
(The Ring)
[Black Speech] <i>Sherkuk-ishi</i>
[English] In your blood

1040
01:38:54,531 --> 01:38:56,332
Isildur s bane.

1041
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:57,192
Boromir!

1042
01:38:57,193 --> 01:38:58,541
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1043
01:38:58,542 --> 01:39:00,961
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu...</i>
{\an8} [English] Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...

1044
01:39:00,962 --> 01:39:04,495
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul...</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them...

1045
01:39:04,496 --> 01:39:04,881
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ombi kuzd-durbagu... shirku</i>
{\an8} [English] Seven for the Dwarf-lords... blood

1046
01:39:04,882 --> 01:39:08,052
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg thrakatulûk...</i>
[English] ...One ring to bring them all...

1047
01:39:09,076 --> 01:39:10,961
{\an8} (The Ring)
{\an8} [Black Speech] <i>Ash Burz-Durbagu burzum-ishi...</i>
{\an8} [English] One for the Dark lord on his dark throne...

1048
01:39:10,962 --> 01:39:15,282
(Gandalf)
[Black Speech] <i>...Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.</i>
[English] ...and in the darkness bind them.

1049
01:39:21,432 --> 01:39:25,133
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1050
01:39:25,533 --> 01:39:29,033
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

1051
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:31,333
...for the black speech of Mordor...

1052
01:39:31,733 --> 01:39:33,033
...may yet be heard...

1053
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:36,133
...in every corner of the West!

1054
01:39:36,433 --> 01:39:39,033
The ring is altogether evil.

1055
01:39:39,533 --> 01:39:40,933
It is a gift.

1056
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:43,633
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1057
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:46,333
Why not use this ring?

1058
01:39:46,633 --> 01:39:49,334
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

1059
01:39:49,634 --> 01:39:53,734
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1060
01:39:54,234 --> 01:39:56,334
...are your lands kept safe.

1061
01:39:58,134 --> 01:40:02,334
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1062
01:40:02,734 --> 01:40:06,334
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1063
01:40:07,134 --> 01:40:11,034
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1064
01:40:11,434 --> 01:40:14,835
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1065
01:40:15,135 --> 01:40:17,035
This is no mere ranger.

1066
01:40:18,135 --> 01:40:21,635
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1067
01:40:22,335 --> 01:40:25,135
You owe him your allegiance.

1068
01:40:29,335 --> 01:40:31,235
Aragorn.

1069
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:35,835
This is Isildur s heir?

1070
01:40:38,235 --> 01:40:40,936
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1071
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:44,316
[Sindarin] <i>Havo dad, Legolas.</i>
[English] Sit down, Legolas.

1072
01:40:47,836 --> 01:40:50,636
Gondor has no king.

1073
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:54,236
Gondor needs no king.

1074
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:04,437
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1075
01:41:05,637 --> 01:41:08,937
You have only one choice.

1076
01:41:09,237 --> 01:41:11,537
The ring must be destroyed.

1077
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:19,337
What are we waiting for?

1078
01:41:24,587 --> 01:41:29,699
[Black Speech] <i>Daghburz-ishi makha, ghurarmu shirku.</i>
[English] In the land of Mordor, a sacrifice of blood.

1079
01:41:31,538 --> 01:41:34,438
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1080
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:38,938
...by any craft that we here possess.

1081
01:41:39,638 --> 01:41:43,538
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1082
01:41:44,038 --> 01:41:47,638
Only there can it be unmade.

1083
01:41:48,938 --> 01:41:51,338
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1084
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:55,342
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1085
01:41:55,343 --> 01:41:58,379
[Black Speech] <i>Makha gulshu darulu.</i>
[English] Where the Shadows lie.

1086
01:41:58,439 --> 01:42:00,539
One of you...

1087
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:03,239
...must do this.

1088
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,839
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1089
01:42:10,839 --> 01:42:14,339
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1090
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:19,239
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1091
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:23,740
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1092
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,540
It is a barren wasteland...

1093
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:30,240
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1094
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,440
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1095
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:38,840
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1096
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:43,540
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1097
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,340
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1098
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,141
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1099
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:56,641
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1100
01:42:58,841 --> 01:43:01,241
Never trust an elf!

1101
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:08,141
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1102
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:11,441
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1103
01:43:11,991 --> 01:43:14,771
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1104
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:17,282
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1105
01:43:17,292 --> 01:43:19,382
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1106
01:43:19,392 --> 01:43:21,491
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1107
01:43:21,492 --> 01:43:23,482
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1108
01:43:23,492 --> 01:43:25,691
[Black Speech] <i>...Ash nazg gimbatul.</i>
[English] ...One ring to find them.

1109
01:43:25,692 --> 01:43:27,592
[Black Speech] <i>Ash nazg durbatulûk...</i>
[English] One ring to rule them all...

1110
01:43:30,242 --> 01:43:32,242
I will take it.

1111
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,042
I will take it.

1112
01:43:42,843 --> 01:43:45,843
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1113
01:43:54,143 --> 01:43:55,243
Though...

1114
01:43:58,443 --> 01:44:00,243
...I do not know the way.

1115
01:44:02,243 --> 01:44:06,344
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1116
01:44:06,744 --> 01:44:10,044
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1117
01:44:11,244 --> 01:44:14,244
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1118
01:44:15,044 --> 01:44:16,344
...I will.

1119
01:44:19,644 --> 01:44:21,844
You have my sword.

1120
01:44:23,744 --> 01:44:25,744
And you have my bow.

1121
01:44:26,444 --> 01:44:28,744
And my ax.

1122
01:44:35,945 --> 01:44:38,745
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1123
01:44:40,945 --> 01:44:44,445
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1124
01:44:45,145 --> 01:44:47,545
...then Gondor will see it done.

1125
01:44:50,145 --> 01:44:54,745
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1126
01:44:55,146 --> 01:44:59,846
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1127
01:45:00,546 --> 01:45:02,346
Oy. We're coming too!

1128
01:45:04,546 --> 01:45:07,245
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1129
01:45:07,246 --> 01:45:10,646
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1130
01:45:11,146 --> 01:45:12,345
...mission.

1131
01:45:12,346 --> 01:45:13,896
Quest.

1132
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:15,396
Thing.

1133
01:45:17,196 --> 01:45:19,896
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1134
01:45:21,597 --> 01:45:23,397
Nine companions.

1135
01:45:25,197 --> 01:45:26,997
So be it.

1136
01:45:27,397 --> 01:45:30,397
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1137
01:45:31,097 --> 01:45:32,897
Great!

1138
01:45:33,297 --> 01:45:35,397
Where are we going?
