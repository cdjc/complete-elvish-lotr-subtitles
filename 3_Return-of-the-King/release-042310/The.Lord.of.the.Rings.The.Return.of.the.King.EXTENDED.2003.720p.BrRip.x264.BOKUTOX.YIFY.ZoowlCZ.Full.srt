5
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,535
I've got one!

6
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,164
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

7
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,459
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

8
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:37,511
Deagol!

9
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,735
Deagol?

10
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,529
Deagol.

11
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,423
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

12
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,676
Why?

13
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,014
Because...

14
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,940
it's my birthday and I wants it.

15
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:52,238
My precious.

16
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,716
They cursed us.

17
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,260
Murderer.

18
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,884
"Murderer" they called us.

19
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,847
They cursed us and drove us away.

20
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,686
Gollum.

21
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,563
Gollum.

22
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,688
Gollum.

23
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,238
And we wept, precious.

24
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,989
We wept to be so alone.

25
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,363
- and cool
- So nice for feet

26
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:40,753
And we only wish To catch a fish

27
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,172
So juicy sweet

28
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,058
And we forgot the taste of bread...

29
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:57,844
the sound of trees...

30
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,934
the softness of the wind.

31
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:08,238
We even forgot our own name.

32
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:22,790
My precious.

33
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,288
Wake up!

34
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,002
Wake up!

35
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,969
Wake up, sleepies.

36
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,010
We must go, yes.

37
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,850
We must go at once.

38
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:25,479
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

39
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,230
I've gone and had too much.

40
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,355
Must be getting late.

41
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,025
No.

42
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,108
It isn't.

43
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,320
It isn't midday yet.

44
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,069
The days are growing darker.

45
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,543
Come on!

46
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,207
Must go! No time!

47
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,756
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

48
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,799
No time to lose, silly.

49
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:09,845
Here.

50
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,896
What about you?

51
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:18,440
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

52
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,408
Sam.

53
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,538
All right.

54
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,196
We don't have that much left.

55
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,245
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

56
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,339
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

57
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:36,918
I've rationed it.

58
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,086
There should be enough.

59
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,461
For what?

60
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,884
The journey home.

61
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,058
Come, Hobbitses.

62
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,319
Very close now.

63
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,739
Very close to Mordor.

64
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,578
No safe places here.

65
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,903
Hurry.

66
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,006
It's good.

67
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,669
Definitely from the Shire.

68
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,011
Longbottom Leaf.

69
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:18,683
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

70
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,025
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

71
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:27,774
Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.

72
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,818
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

73
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,669
Welcome, my lords...

74
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,086
to Isengard!

75
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:54,220
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

76
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:59,386
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

77
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,731
We are sitting on a field of victory...

78
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,400
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

79
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:11,320
The salted pork is particularly good.

80
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,240
Salted pork?

81
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:18,870
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

82
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,876
who's taken over management of Isengard.

83
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:27,422
Young Master Gandalf.

84
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm glad you've come.

85
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,758
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

86
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:40,599
But there is a wizard to manage here...

87
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,763
locked in his tower.

88
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,770
Show yourself.

89
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,734
Be careful.

90
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,198
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

91
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,488
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

92
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,698
No.

93
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,361
We need him alive.

94
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,946
We need him to talk.

95
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:09,046
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

96
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,708
and made peace afterwards.

97
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:15,841
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

98
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:19,216
Can we not have peace, you and I?

99
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,300
We shall have peace.

100
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,351
We shall have peace...

101
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,566
when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...

102
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,486
and the children that lie dead there!

103
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:37,402
We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...

104
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,652
whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...

105
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:43,363
against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!

106
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:50,503
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

107
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,664
we shall have peace.

108
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,131
Gibbets and crows?

109
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,716
Dotard!

110
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,017
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

111
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,511
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

112
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,606
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

113
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:15,772
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

114
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,899
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

115
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:21,446
Thousands more are now at risk.

116
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,990
But you could save them, Saruman.

117
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

118
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,908
So you have come here for information.

119
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,621
I have some for you.

120
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:41,046
Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.

121
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,462
Something that you have failed to see.

122
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,474
But the Great Eye has seen it.

123
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:54,221
Even now he presses his advantage.

124
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:59,318
His attack will come soon.

125
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,655
You're all going to die.

126
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,411
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

127
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:14,207
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

128
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:20,463
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

129
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:25,466
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

130
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,595
those he professes to love.

131
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:34,185
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

132
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:37,391
before you sent him to his doom?

133
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:44,528
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

134
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,024
I've heard enough!

135
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,027
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

136
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,196
No.

137
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:53,870
Come down, Saruman...

138
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,990
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

139
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,498
I have no use for it!

140
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,180
Saruman...

141
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,391
your staff is broken.

142
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,731
Grima, you need not follow him.

143
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,578
You were not always as you are now.

144
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,580
You were once a Man of Rohan.

145
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,993
Come down.

146
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,871
A Man of Rohan?

147
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:43,036
What is the house of Rohan...

148
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:46,879
but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...

149
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,751
and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?

150
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:57,716
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

151
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:02,931
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

152
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,984
Grima...

153
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,694
come down.

154
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,442
Be free of him.

155
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:15,614
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

156
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:18,617
Get down, cur!

157
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:21,655
Saruman!

158
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,455
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

159
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:27,121
Tell us what you know!

160
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:33,875
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

161
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:37,589
I will not be held prisoner here.

162
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,252
Send word to all our allies...

163
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,337
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

164
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,001
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

165
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:36,144
The filth of Saruman...

166
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,154
is washing away.

167
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:44,870
Trees will come back to live here.

168
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,532
Young trees.

169
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,915
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

170
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,546
Bless my bark!

171
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:03,596
Peregrin Took!

172
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,388
I'll take that, my lad.

173
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,435
Quickly, now.

174
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:04,197
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

175
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,907
Hail the victorious dead.

176
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,488
Hail!

177
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,374
No pauses.

178
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,714
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

179
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,881
So it's a drinking game?

180
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,137
Last one standing wins.

181
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:38,474
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

182
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,061
To victory!

183
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,450
[Rohirric] Westu Aragorn hál.
[English] Be-thou Aragorn well!

184
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,530
Be thou, Aragorn, well.

185
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,687
I am happy for you.

186
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,479
He is an honorable man.

187
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,362
You are both honorable men.

188
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:38,541
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

189
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,542
Don't listen to me.

190
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,879
You are young.

191
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,379
And tonight is for you.

192
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,396
Here, here.

193
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:16,825
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

194
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,453
I feel something.

195
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:28,077
A slight tingle in my fingers.

196
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,375
I think it's affecting me.

197
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:34,009
What did I say?

198
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:37,512
He can't hold his liquor.

199
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,184
Game over.

200
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,773
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

201
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:53,893
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

202
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:58,449
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

203
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,533
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

204
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:05,872
But the only brew for the brave and true

205
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,783
Pippin!

206
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,291
But the only brew for the brave and true

207
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,338
Comes from The Green Dragon

208
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,890
Thank you! I win!

209
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,134
No news of Frodo?

210
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,812
No word. Nothing.

211
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,808
We have time.

212
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,605
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

213
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:40,442
Do we know that?

214
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:45,996
What does your heart tell you?

215
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,380
That Frodo is alive.

216
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,343
Yes.

217
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,089
Yes, he's alive.

218
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,187
Too risky. Too risky.

219
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,600
Thieves.

220
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:13,812
They stole it from us.

221
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:17,483
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

222
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,365
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

223
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,071
Mustn't ruin it now.

224
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,321
But they knows.

225
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,370
They knows.

226
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,161
They suspects us.

227
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,911
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

228
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,671
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

229
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:43,715
No. Not.

230
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:48,134
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

231
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:53,136
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

232
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:55,851
And we will.

233
00:23:56,024 --> 00:24:00,069
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

234
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:06,076
It's ours!

235
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,912
Ours!

236
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,908
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

237
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:16,498
Patience! Patience, my love.

238
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,047
First we must lead them to her.

239
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:26,918
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

240
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,765
Yes, the stairs. And then?

241
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,932
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

242
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:39,519
until we come to the tunnel.

243
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,020
And when they go in...

244
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,982
there's no coming out.

245
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:49,778
She's always hungry.

246
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:54,746
She always needs to feed.

247
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,325
She must eat.

248
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,622
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

249
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,545
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

250
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,796
No.

251
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:08,674
Not very nice at all, my love.

252
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,632
She hungers for sweeter meats.

253
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,633
Hobbit meat.

254
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:18,636
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

255
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:21,897
then we will find it.

256
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:26,394
And take it for me!

257
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,566
For us.

258
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:33,075
Yes. We meant "for us."

259
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:36,695
Gollum. Gollum.

260
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:41,368
The precious will be ours...

261
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,039
once the Hobbitses are dead!

262
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,007
You treacherous little toad!

263
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,007
No! No! Master!

264
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,804
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

265
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,351
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

266
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,681
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

267
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,763
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

268
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:08,521
who hates Smeagol...

269
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,482
and who makes up nasty lies.

270
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:14,324
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

271
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Sam!

272
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,657
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

273
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:23,535
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

274
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,876
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

275
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,541
You don't see it, do you?

276
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,374
He's a villain.

277
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,001
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

278
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,716
I need you on my side.

279
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,841
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

280
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,307
I know, Sam. I know.

281
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,849
Trust me.

282
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,397
Come, Smeagol.

283
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,802
What time is it?

284
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,633
Not yet dawn.

285
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:14,599
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

286
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,773
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

287
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,485
I stood upon the brink.

288
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,575
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

289
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,283
A light shone behind me...

290
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,324
but I could not turn.

291
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:37,918
I could only stand there, waiting.

292
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,086
Night changes many thoughts.

293
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:44,627
Sleep, Eowyn.

294
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,421
Sleep...

295
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,016
while you can.

296
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,456
The stars are veiled.

297
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:22,961
Something stirs in the east.

298
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,752
A sleepless malice.

299
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,550
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

300
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:47,692
What are you doing?

301
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:53,786
Pippin!

302
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,038
Pippin?

303
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,262
Pippin.

304
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:20,605
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

305
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:21,886
Just one more time.

306
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:24,224
Put it back.

307
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,285
Pippin.

308
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:44,288
No!

309
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:50,628
Pippin.

310
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,169
He is here.

311
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,635
I see you.

312
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,268
Pippin!

313
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,661
Help! Gandalf, help!

314
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,287
Someone help him!

315
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:30,870
Pippin!

316
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,252
Fool of a Took!

317
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,569
Look at me.

318
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,661
Gandalf, forgive me.

319
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,703
Look at me.

320
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,700
What did you see?

321
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,287
A tree.

322
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:15,130
There was a white tree...

323
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,794
in a courtyard of stone.

324
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,875
It was dead.

325
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,885
The city was burning.

326
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

327
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,145
I saw...

328
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,904
I saw him.

329
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,150
I could hear his voice in my head.

330
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,734
And what did you tell him?

331
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,739
Speak!

332
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:55,084
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

333
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,714
He hurt me.

334
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:59,337
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

335
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,301
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

336
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,382
A fool...

337
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,848
but an honest fool he remains.

338
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:14,847
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

339
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,272
We've been strangely fortunate.

340
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:22,311
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

341
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,190
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

342
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,535
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

343
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:34,032
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

344
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,332
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

345
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:40,287
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

346
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,381
Sauron fears this.

347
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,880
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

348
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:50,464
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

349
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,141
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

350
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:58,226
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

351
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,356
Tell me...

352
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,311
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

353
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,028
What do we owe Gondor?

354
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,202
- I will go.
- No!

355
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:17,539
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

356
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:23,501
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

357
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:28,510
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

358
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,429
Understand this:

359
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:35,263
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

360
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,845
I ride for Minas Tirith...

361
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:43,777
and I won't be going alone.

362
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:49,193
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

363
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,860
Hurry! Hurry!

364
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,779
Where are we going?

365
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,199
Why did you look?

366
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:59,123
Why do you always have to look?

367
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,375
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

368
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,247
I'm sorry, all right?

369
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,258
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

370
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:11,967
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

371
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:15,885
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

372
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,979
And you...? You're coming with me?

373
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:23,599
Merry?

374
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,054
Come on.

375
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:31,948
How far is Minas Tirith?

376
00:35:32,115 --> 00:35:34,736
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

377
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,409
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

378
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,616
Here.

379
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,582
Something for the road.

380
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,416
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

381
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:49,584
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

382
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,248
But... But we'll see each other soon.

383
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:58,087
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

384
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,140
I don't know what's going to happen.

385
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,019
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

386
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,646
Show us the meaning of haste.

387
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,724
Merry!

388
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,316
Merry!

389
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,290
He's always followed me...

390
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:34,004
everywhere I went...

391
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,133
since before we were tweens.

392
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:41,217
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

393
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,466
but I was always there to get him out.

394
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,811
Now he's gone.

395
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:52,399
Just like Frodo and Sam.

396
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,778
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

397
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,607
They're a most hardy folk.

398
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,857
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

399
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:18,629
Take her by the safest road.

400
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,293
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

401
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:25,338
It waits to carry her across the sea.

402
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,886
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

403
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,585
There is nothing for you here...

404
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:40,293
only death.

405
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:48,877
Lady Arwen...

406
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,715
we cannot delay.

407
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:55,430
My lady!

408
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,452
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

409
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,582
You have the gift of foresight.

410
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:21,544
What did you see?

411
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:25,505
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

412
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,172
But there is also life.

413
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:34,140
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

414
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,304
That future is almost gone.

415
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,470
But it is not lost.

416
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,272
Nothing is certain.

417
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:48,691
Some things are certain.

418
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,327
If I leave him now...

419
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,116
I will regret it forever.

420
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,532
It is time.

421
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:10,581
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

422
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,176
A light from the shadow shall spring

423
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,632
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

424
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,227
The crownless again shall be king

425
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,028
Re-forge the sword.

426
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
[Sindarin] Ada.
[English] Father.

427
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,604
Your hands are cold.

428
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:18,109
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

429
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:23,446
This was my choice.

430
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
[Sindarin] Ada...
[English] Father...

431
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,579
Whether by your will or not...

432
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:33,213
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

433
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,263
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

434
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,141
Minas Tirith.

435
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:40,061
City of kings.

436
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,227
Make way!

437
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,251
It's the tree.

438
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:46,085
Gandalf. Gandalf.

439
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,502
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

440
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,506
The tree of the king.

441
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:53,351
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

442
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:56,186
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

443
00:43:56,937 --> 00:44:00,472
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

444
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:04,809
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

445
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:08,730
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

446
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:12,368
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

447
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:18,071
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

448
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:54,738
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

449
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:04,957
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

450
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,290
Perhaps you come to explain this.

451
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,472
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

452
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,948
Boromir died to save us...

453
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:38,778
my kinsman and me.

454
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:42,452
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

455
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:51,412
I offer you my service, such as it is...

456
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,958
in payment of this debt.

457
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,469
This is my first command to you.

458
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:03,633
How did you escape and my son did not...

459
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,302
so mighty a man as he was?

460
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,313
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

461
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,476
and Boromir was pierced by many.

462
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:18,322
Get up.

463
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:23,117
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

464
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,322
but it is not now.

465
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,246
War is coming.

466
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:32,996
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

467
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:37,335
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

468
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:42,385
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

469
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:47,052
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

470
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:52,180
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

471
00:46:52,357 --> 00:46:55,394
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

472
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:01,692
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

473
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:04,951
I have seen more than you know.

474
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,323
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

475
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,368
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

476
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:15,243
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

477
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:21,376
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

478
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:26,380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

479
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:31,053
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

480
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:37,064
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

481
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:41,647
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

482
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:48,618
Come.

483
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:59,118
All has turned to vain ambition.

484
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:02,748
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

485
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:08,423
A thousand years this city has stood.

486
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,923
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

487
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,350
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

488
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,064
will never bloom again.

489
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:20,600
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

490
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:23,943
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

491
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:28,858
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

492
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:31,951
before it fell into decay.

493
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:35,371
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

494
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,834
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

495
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,954
and counted the old names of their descent...

496
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,917
dearer than the names of their sons.

497
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:50,132
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

498
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:55,644
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

499
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,594
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

500
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:02,890
The line of kings failed.

501
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:05,981
The White Tree withered.

502
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,859
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

503
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:22,830
Mordor.

504
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:27,002
Yes, there it lies.

505
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:31,175
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

506
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,839
A storm is coming.

507
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:38,433
This is not the weather of the world.

508
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,808
This is a device of Sauron's making.

509
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:44,727
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

510
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,771
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

511
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,771
so he covers the face of the sun...

512
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:53,694
to ease their passage along the road to war.

513
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:57,152
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

514
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,578
it will begin.

515
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,826
Well...

516
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,537
Minas Tirith...

517
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,873
very impressive.

518
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,668
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

519
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,048
There's no leaving this city.

520
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,590
Help must come to us.

521
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,770
It must be getting near teatime.

522
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,637
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

523
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,398
We're not in decent places.

524
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,194
Mr. Frodo?

525
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,442
What is it?

526
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,287
It's just a feeling.

527
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,870
I don't think I'll be coming back.

528
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,922
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

529
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:00,427
That's just morbid thinking.

530
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,345
We're going there and back again...

531
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:05,806
just like Mr. Bilbo.

532
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,894
You'll see.

533
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:20,690
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

534
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,124
Long ago, when there was a king.

535
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:52,605
Mr. Frodo, look.

536
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:56,984
The king has got a crown again.

537
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:12,368
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

538
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:33,270
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

539
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:37,685
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

540
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:41,776
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

541
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:45,315
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

542
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,861
Ridiculous Hobbit.

543
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,246
Guard of the Citadel.

544
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,586
Thank you.

545
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,220
There's no more stars.

546
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:19,930
Is it time?

547
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,852
Yes.

548
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:27,148
It's so quiet.

549
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:32,404
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

550
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,449
I don't want to be in a battle...

551
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:42,249
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

552
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,418
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

553
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:53,882
There never was much hope.

554
00:53:55,851 --> 00:53:57,594
Just a fool's hope.

555
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,270
Our enemy is ready.

556
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,114
His full strength's gathered.

557
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:12,779
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

558
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,987
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

559
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:18,866
mercenaries from the coast.

560
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,613
All will answer Mordor's call.

561
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,334
Come on.

562
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:27,795
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

563
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,334
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

564
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,632
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

565
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:40,472
the last defense of this city will be gone.

566
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,689
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

567
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,148
Gandalf?

568
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,532
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

569
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,828
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

570
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,160
The one they say no living man can kill.

571
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,331
The Witch King of Angmar.

572
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,798
You've met him before.

573
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,044
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

574
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,309
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

575
00:55:28,774 --> 00:55:31,230
the greatest of the Nine.

576
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:35,020
Minas Morgul is his lair.

577
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:42,026
The Dead City.

578
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:47,411
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

579
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:56,791
Quick. Quick.

580
00:55:56,968 --> 00:56:00,965
They will see. They will see.

581
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,521
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

582
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:19,562
The way into Mordor.

583
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,070
The secret stair.

584
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,866
Climb.

585
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,893
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

586
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:57,603
- What's it doing?
- No.

587
00:56:57,777 --> 00:57:00,861
- They're calling me.
- No.

588
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,471
Hide! Hide!

589
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,856
I can feel his blade.

590
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:33,658
We come to it at last.

591
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:38,367
The great battle of our time.

592
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:20,787
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

593
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:33,676
The board is set.

594
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,383
The pieces are moving.

595
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,603
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

596
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:44,438
And then it's into the tunnel.

597
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:47,809
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

598
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,110
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

599
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:54,196
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

600
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:55,942
One sniff something's not right...

601
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:59,283
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

602
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:02,164
No more slinker. No more stinker.

603
01:00:02,497 --> 01:00:05,119
You're gone. Got it?

604
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:07,993
I'm watching you.

605
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,334
What was that about?

606
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,917
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

607
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,431
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

608
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:32,183
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

609
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:38,609
You must not fail me.

610
01:01:12,857 --> 01:01:15,941
It's been very quiet across the river.

611
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,435
The Orcs are lying low.

612
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:20,605
The garrison may have moved out.

613
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,445
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

614
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:27,904
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

615
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:54,428
Quiet.

616
01:01:58,526 --> 01:02:00,484
We need 10 more.

617
01:02:21,799 --> 01:02:23,341
Kill him!

618
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:43,058
They're not coming from the north.

619
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:48,817
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

620
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:53,864
Faster.

621
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,382
Draw swords.

622
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,513
Hold! Hold them!

623
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:28,686
What?

624
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:42,653
Amon Din

625
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,494
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

626
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:58,967
Hope is kindled.

627
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:35,727
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

628
01:07:36,938 --> 01:07:38,562
Gondor calls for aid.

629
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:51,992
And Rohan will answer.

630
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:55,198
Muster the Rohirrim.

631
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:12,261
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

632
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,808
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

633
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:22,267
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

634
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,561
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

635
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,062
- Gamling.
- My lord.

636
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,813
Make haste across the Riddermark.

637
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:30,110
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

638
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:31,859
I will.

639
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:39,120
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

640
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:43,204
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

641
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,668
The men have found their captain.

642
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:55,177
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

643
01:08:55,347 --> 01:08:56,925
You have given us hope.

644
01:09:00,143 --> 01:09:02,101
Excuse me.

645
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:04,932
I have a sword.

646
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:06,607
Please accept it.

647
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:12,230
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

648
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,734
And gladly I accept it.

649
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:22,908
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

650
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:28,993
Horse-Men.

651
01:09:29,672 --> 01:09:35,295
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

652
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:38,632
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

653
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:42,222
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

654
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:04,153
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

655
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:08,198
the doom of our time will be decided.

656
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:16,335
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

657
01:10:16,509 --> 01:10:20,043
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

658
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:05,095
Faramir!

659
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:15,096
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

660
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:18,775
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

661
01:11:27,536 --> 01:11:29,778
Nazgul.

662
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,621
Take cover!

663
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:37,331
Nazgul!

664
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:41,169
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

665
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:49,638
Fall back!

666
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:01,268
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

667
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,838
The age of Men is over.

668
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:35,636
The time of the Orc has come.

669
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,346
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

670
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,355
Take cover, my lord!

671
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,981
It's coming!

672
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,903
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

673
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,243
Pull!

674
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,377
Mithrandir.

675
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:58,299
They broke through our defenses.

676
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,680
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

677
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:05,932
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

678
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:10,649
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

679
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,439
Faramir?

680
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:22,200
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

681
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,578
No.

682
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:27,459
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

683
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:31,752
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

684
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:33,999
Not two days ago.

685
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:38,927
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

686
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,260
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

687
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:46,849
What does that mean?

688
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:51,931
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

689
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:54,148
Tell me all you know.

690
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:58,736
This is how you would serve your city?

691
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:02,193
You would risk its utter ruin?

692
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:04,822
I did what I judged to be right.

693
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:08,539
What you judged to be right.

694
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:15,040
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

695
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:23,838
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

696
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:27,017
Hidden.

697
01:15:27,435 --> 01:15:30,187
Dark and deep in the vaults...

698
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:32,513
not to be used.

699
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:41,570
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

700
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,072
I would not use the Ring.

701
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:47,328
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

702
01:15:47,663 --> 01:15:52,490
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

703
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:54,910
as a king of old.

704
01:15:56,713 --> 01:16:00,462
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

705
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:03,340
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

706
01:16:03,553 --> 01:16:06,091
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

707
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:09,634
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

708
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,051
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

709
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:16,097
And when he returned...

710
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:18,893
you would not have known your son.

711
01:16:19,068 --> 01:16:21,606
Boromir was loyal to me!

712
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,352
Not some wizard's pupil!

713
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:33,826
Father?

714
01:16:46,512 --> 01:16:48,421
My son.

715
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,039
Leave me.

716
01:17:49,614 --> 01:17:52,152
Careful, master. Careful.

717
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:55,410
Very far to fall.

718
01:17:57,914 --> 01:18:01,828
Very dangerous are the stairs.

719
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:07,042
Come, master.

720
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:16,012
Come to Smeagol.

721
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:23,848
Mr. Frodo.

722
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:26,399
Get back, you!

723
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,773
Don't touch him!

724
01:18:32,906 --> 01:18:35,741
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

725
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:39,610
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

726
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:42,160
Master?

727
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:46,409
Master carries heavy burden.

728
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:52,007
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

729
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:55,425
Fat one cannot know.

730
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:00,223
Smeagol look after master.

731
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:03,641
He wants it.

732
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:08,354
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

733
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:13,980
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

734
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:18,022
The fat one will take it from you.

735
01:19:25,248 --> 01:19:29,578
Send forth all legions.

736
01:19:29,753 --> 01:19:33,798
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

737
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:37,628
Slay them all.

738
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:45,093
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

739
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,845
Where are Theoden's riders?

740
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:53,597
Will Rohan's army come?

741
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:56,018
Mithrandir.

742
01:19:57,071 --> 01:20:00,938
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

743
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:08,451
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

744
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:16,248
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

745
01:20:16,423 --> 01:20:17,918
It was well-done.

746
01:20:21,094 --> 01:20:25,139
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

747
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,429
You are to join the tower guard.

748
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:31,977
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

749
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:34,602
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

750
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:36,316
A very foolish one...

751
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:40,731
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

752
01:20:40,905 --> 01:20:43,657
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

753
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:45,616
My father had it made for me.

754
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:47,990
Well...

755
01:20:48,163 --> 01:20:50,154
I'm taller than you were then.

756
01:20:50,331 --> 01:20:53,665
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

757
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:58,669
Never fitted me either.

758
01:20:58,839 --> 01:21:01,675
Boromir was always the soldier.

759
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:07,086
They were so alike, he and my father.

760
01:21:09,183 --> 01:21:10,808
Proud.

761
01:21:10,976 --> 01:21:12,174
Stubborn even.

762
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:15,432
But strong.

763
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,107
I think you have strength of a different kind.

764
01:21:20,736 --> 01:21:23,191
And one day your father will see it.

765
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:31,151
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

766
01:21:31,329 --> 01:21:32,824
in peace or war...

767
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:35,912
in living or dying...

768
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:38,538
from...

769
01:21:41,214 --> 01:21:44,001
From this hour henceforth...

770
01:21:44,175 --> 01:21:46,084
until my lord release me...

771
01:21:47,595 --> 01:21:49,801
or death take me.

772
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:52,880
And I shall not forget it...

773
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:56,428
nor fail to reward that which is given.

774
01:22:04,028 --> 01:22:06,316
Fealty with love.

775
01:22:07,405 --> 01:22:09,066
Valor with honor.

776
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,992
Disloyalty with vengeance.

777
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:26,709
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

778
01:22:26,883 --> 01:22:29,635
defenses that your brother long held intact.

779
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:32,293
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

780
01:22:32,472 --> 01:22:35,259
the river in Pelennor unfought.

781
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:37,093
Osgiliath must be retaken.

782
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:39,308
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

783
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:42,766
Much must be risked in war.

784
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:49,351
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

785
01:22:55,577 --> 01:22:58,827
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

786
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,625
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

787
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:07,789
Yes.

788
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,671
I wish that.

789
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,549
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

790
01:23:23,396 --> 01:23:26,314
I will do what I can in his stead.

791
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:38,950
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

792
01:23:41,038 --> 01:23:44,656
That will depend on the manner of your return.

793
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:10,281
What are you up to?

794
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:11,703
Sneaking off, are we?

795
01:25:12,419 --> 01:25:14,245
Sneaking?

796
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:17,412
Sneaking?

797
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,007
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

798
01:25:22,178 --> 01:25:27,254
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

799
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,591
and they say "sneak."

800
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:32,801
Sneak?

801
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:36,143
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

802
01:25:36,316 --> 01:25:38,938
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

803
01:25:40,195 --> 01:25:42,401
You just startled me is all.

804
01:25:42,906 --> 01:25:44,733
What were you doing?

805
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,490
Sneaking.

806
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:51,955
Fine. Have it your own way.

807
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:56,700
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

808
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:59,043
We have to be moving on.

809
01:26:04,218 --> 01:26:05,796
It's dark still.

810
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,176
It's always dark here.

811
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:14,343
It's gone!

812
01:26:15,563 --> 01:26:18,433
- The Elven bread.
- What?

813
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,066
That's all we have left.

814
01:26:24,154 --> 01:26:26,646
He took it. He must have!

815
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:30,408
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

816
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:33,495
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

817
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,830
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

818
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,542
He doesn't eat it.

819
01:26:39,545 --> 01:26:41,870
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

820
01:26:42,922 --> 01:26:44,750
What's this?

821
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:50,761
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

822
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,133
He took it.

823
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:58,186
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

824
01:26:58,355 --> 01:27:00,146
That's a filthy lie!

825
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,521
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

826
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:03,937
- Sam!
- Call me...

827
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,355
Stop it!

828
01:27:06,362 --> 01:27:07,560
Sam!

829
01:27:08,864 --> 01:27:12,482
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

830
01:27:13,536 --> 01:27:19,075
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

831
01:27:19,249 --> 01:27:21,372
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

832
01:27:21,543 --> 01:27:23,619
- I'm all right.
- No.

833
01:27:23,795 --> 01:27:26,880
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

834
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:29,171
It's that Gollum.

835
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:31,051
It's this place.

836
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,792
It's that thing around your neck.

837
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:38,589
I could help a bit.

838
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:41,437
I could carry it for a while.

839
01:27:41,605 --> 01:27:43,348
Carry it for a while.

840
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:44,768
I could carry it... I could carry it.

841
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:50,856
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

842
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,229
Get away!

843
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:53,984
I don't want to keep it.

844
01:27:57,579 --> 01:27:59,570
I just want to help.

845
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:04,246
See? See?

846
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:07,834
He wants it for himself.

847
01:28:08,006 --> 01:28:09,713
Shut up, you!

848
01:28:10,257 --> 01:28:12,084
Go away! Get out of here!

849
01:28:12,259 --> 01:28:14,086
No, Sam.

850
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:15,506
It's you.

851
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,432
I'm sorry, Sam.

852
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:24,478
But he's a liar.

853
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:27,315
He's poisoned you against me.

854
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:30,642
You can't help me anymore.

855
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:34,485
You don't mean that.

856
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:38,783
Go home.

857
01:29:58,821 --> 01:30:00,612
Faramir!

858
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:02,690
Faramir!

859
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:06,241
Your father's will has turned to madness.

860
01:30:07,412 --> 01:30:09,452
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

861
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:12,532
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

862
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:16,086
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

863
01:30:16,713 --> 01:30:19,500
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

864
01:30:19,674 --> 01:30:22,878
her memory, her wisdom.

865
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:28,679
Your father loves you, Faramir.

866
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,393
He will remember it before the end.

867
01:31:42,004 --> 01:31:43,546
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

868
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,023
Well...

869
01:31:48,573 --> 01:31:50,197
yes.

870
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:54,657
At least, well enough for my own people.

871
01:31:56,289 --> 01:31:58,696
But we have no songs for great halls...

872
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,995
and evil times.

873
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:05,002
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

874
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,211
Come, sing me a song.

875
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:23,604
Home is behind

876
01:32:23,773 --> 01:32:27,522
The world ahead

877
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:35,782
And there are many paths to tread

878
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:41,113
Through shadow

879
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:45,454
To the edge of night

880
01:32:47,129 --> 01:32:52,207
Until the stars are all alight

881
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:59,549
Mist and shadow

882
01:32:59,725 --> 01:33:04,018
Cloud and shade

883
01:33:06,398 --> 01:33:09,732
All shall fade

884
01:33:12,112 --> 01:33:16,109
All shall

885
01:33:21,872 --> 01:33:24,244
Fade

886
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:52,099
March! March!

887
01:33:52,276 --> 01:33:57,483
March! March! March!

888
01:34:00,952 --> 01:34:03,277
Make way for the king.

889
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:06,780
Make way.

890
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,290
The king is here.

891
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:14,879
My lord.

892
01:34:16,133 --> 01:34:18,089
Hail to you, sire.

893
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:19,749
Grimbold, how many?

894
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:22,383
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

895
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:26,017
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

896
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:31,092
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

897
01:34:48,164 --> 01:34:50,287
Six thousand spears.

898
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:53,326
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

899
01:34:53,627 --> 01:34:56,996
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

900
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,501
More will come.

901
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:04,839
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

902
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:07,586
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

903
01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:29,401
The horses are restless...

904
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:31,073
and the men are quiet.

905
01:35:31,539 --> 01:35:34,658
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

906
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:39,001
That road there...

907
01:35:39,922 --> 01:35:41,998
where does that lead?

908
01:35:42,758 --> 01:35:46,590
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

909
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:50,305
None who venture there ever return.

910
01:35:51,516 --> 01:35:53,390
That mountain is evil.

911
01:36:16,332 --> 01:36:18,159
Aragorn.

912
01:36:18,918 --> 01:36:20,827
Let's find some food.

913
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,722
There.

914
01:36:39,688 --> 01:36:42,689
A true esquire of Rohan.

915
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,312
I'm ready.

916
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:51,186
Sorry.

917
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:53,607
It isn't all that dangerous.

918
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:56,444
It's not even sharp.

919
01:36:57,122 --> 01:37:00,538
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

920
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:02,203
Come on.

921
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,872
To the smithy. Go!

922
01:37:10,343 --> 01:37:12,881
You should not encourage him.

923
01:37:13,054 --> 01:37:15,509
You should not doubt him.

924
01:37:15,682 --> 01:37:18,967
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

925
01:37:21,688 --> 01:37:23,265
Why should Merry be left behind?

926
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,060
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

927
01:37:28,235 --> 01:37:31,401
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

928
01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:37,659
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

929
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:40,988
When the fear takes him...

930
01:37:41,164 --> 01:37:46,206
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

931
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:48,744
do you think he would stand and fight?

932
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:52,924
He would flee.

933
01:37:53,093 --> 01:37:55,132
And he would be right to do so.

934
01:37:57,347 --> 01:38:01,297
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

935
01:38:36,968 --> 01:38:40,669
I choose a mortal life.

936
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,470
I wish I could've seen him...

937
01:38:47,604 --> 01:38:50,309
one last time.

938
01:39:01,492 --> 01:39:02,903
Sir?

939
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:07,319
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

940
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:30,058
I take my leave.

941
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,946
My lord Elrond.

942
01:39:46,536 --> 01:39:50,035
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

943
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,118
Arwen is dying.

944
01:39:59,923 --> 01:40:03,968
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

945
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,089
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

946
01:40:08,265 --> 01:40:12,263
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

947
01:40:12,436 --> 01:40:16,184
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

948
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,513
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

949
01:40:19,902 --> 01:40:21,561
The end has come.

950
01:40:21,946 --> 01:40:24,566
It will not be our end, but his.

951
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,906
You ride to war, but not to victory.

952
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:33,576
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

953
01:40:33,748 --> 01:40:38,161
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

954
01:40:38,628 --> 01:40:42,044
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

955
01:40:42,674 --> 01:40:44,750
They'll be in the city in two days.

956
01:40:45,259 --> 01:40:48,094
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

957
01:40:48,804 --> 01:40:50,928
You need more men.

958
01:40:51,307 --> 01:40:53,051
There are none.

959
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:58,724
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

960
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:09,898
Murderers...

961
01:41:10,075 --> 01:41:11,486
traitors.

962
01:41:13,954 --> 01:41:16,112
You would call upon them to fight?

963
01:41:16,289 --> 01:41:17,867
They believe in nothing.

964
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,164
They answer to no one.

965
01:41:20,335 --> 01:41:23,419
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

966
01:41:30,553 --> 01:41:35,678
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

967
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:54,402
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

968
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:13,210
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

969
01:42:13,387 --> 01:42:15,794
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

970
01:42:15,972 --> 01:42:19,839
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

971
01:42:21,686 --> 01:42:23,844
Put aside the Ranger.

972
01:42:24,022 --> 01:42:27,355
Become who you were born to be.

973
01:42:27,525 --> 01:42:29,518
Take the Dimholt road.

974
01:42:33,171 --> 01:42:35,557
[Sindarin] Ónen i-Estel Edain.
[English] I gave hope to Men.

975
01:42:33,531 --> 01:42:36,318
I give hope to Men.

976
01:42:39,303 --> 01:42:40,403
[Sindarin] Ú-chebin...
[English] I have kept...

977
01:42:39,578 --> 01:42:43,707
I keep none for myself.

978
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,204
[Sindarin] ...Estel anim.
[English] ...no hope for me.

979
01:42:55,552 --> 01:42:57,213
Why are you doing this?

980
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,882
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

981
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,385
You cannot abandon the men.

982
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,265
Eowyn...

983
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:10,646
We need you here.

984
01:43:11,776 --> 01:43:13,650
Why have you come?

985
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:17,278
Do you not know?

986
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:29,583
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

987
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:35,914
I cannot give you what you seek.

988
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:53,352
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

989
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:14,790
Just where do you think you're off to?

990
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:16,291
Not this time.

991
01:44:16,464 --> 01:44:18,670
This time you must stay, Gimli.

992
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:24,220
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

993
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:28,053
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

994
01:44:50,372 --> 01:44:52,530
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

995
01:44:52,874 --> 01:44:54,748
Where's he going?

996
01:44:57,337 --> 01:44:59,376
I don't understand.

997
01:45:03,802 --> 01:45:05,593
Lord Aragorn!

998
01:45:06,012 --> 01:45:08,716
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

999
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:12,009
He leaves because there is no hope.

1000
01:45:12,685 --> 01:45:14,808
He leaves because he must.

1001
01:45:14,978 --> 01:45:16,687
Too few have come.

1002
01:45:16,856 --> 01:45:19,014
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

1003
01:45:21,527 --> 01:45:23,187
No...

1004
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:24,857
we cannot.

1005
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:31,525
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

1006
01:45:45,967 --> 01:45:47,711
I have left instruction.

1007
01:45:50,388 --> 01:45:53,638
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

1008
01:46:00,231 --> 01:46:02,473
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1009
01:46:03,735 --> 01:46:06,570
Long may you defend Edoras...

1010
01:46:06,738 --> 01:46:09,063
if the battle goes ill.

1011
01:46:10,157 --> 01:46:13,573
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1012
01:46:15,788 --> 01:46:17,745
Duty?

1013
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:21,245
No.

1014
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,674
I would have you smile again...

1015
01:46:35,098 --> 01:46:40,093
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1016
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:48,440
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1017
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,533
and no more despair.

1018
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:05,449
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1019
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,455
One that is cursed.

1020
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:11,961
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1021
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:15,136
to the last king of Gondor...

1022
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,298
to come to his aid...

1023
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:19,180
to fight.

1024
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:21,841
But when the time came...

1025
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,098
when Gondor's need was dire...

1026
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:27,145
they fled...

1027
01:47:27,315 --> 01:47:30,685
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1028
01:47:31,736 --> 01:47:34,061
And so Isildur cursed them...

1029
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:39,482
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1030
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,956
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1031
01:47:47,418 --> 01:47:49,660
The forgotten people.

1032
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:52,328
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1033
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:54,672
From the north shall he come.

1034
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:56,835
Need shall drive him.

1035
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:01,427
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1036
01:48:19,908 --> 01:48:23,194
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1037
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,707
The way is shut.

1038
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,418
It was made by those who are dead.

1039
01:48:34,046 --> 01:48:36,288
And the Dead keep it.

1040
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:38,383
The way is shut.

1041
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:51,223
Brego!

1042
01:48:54,734 --> 01:48:57,438
I do not fear death.

1043
01:49:09,748 --> 01:49:12,156
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1044
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:16,996
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1045
01:49:17,172 --> 01:49:18,500
Oh.

1046
01:49:18,673 --> 01:49:21,508
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1047
01:49:36,524 --> 01:49:38,766
We must ride light and swift.

1048
01:49:38,943 --> 01:49:40,686
It is a long road ahead.

1049
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:43,946
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1050
01:49:49,453 --> 01:49:52,454
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1051
01:49:52,789 --> 01:49:54,782
All my friends have gone to battle.

1052
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,832
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1053
01:49:57,002 --> 01:49:59,125
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1054
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:01,668
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1055
01:50:02,674 --> 01:50:04,797
I want to fight.

1056
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:07,294
I will say no more.

1057
01:50:24,112 --> 01:50:26,069
Ride with me.

1058
01:50:27,532 --> 01:50:28,942
My lady.

1059
01:50:29,116 --> 01:50:31,488
Form up! Move out!

1060
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:34,864
Form up! Move out!

1061
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:39,156
Ride!

1062
01:50:39,335 --> 01:50:42,289
Ride now to Gondor!

1063
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,800
[Black Speech]  Katmuda!
[English]  Death to men!

1064
01:50:54,324 --> 01:50:55,624
[Black Speech]  Katmuda!
[English]  Death to men!

1065
01:50:55,625 --> 01:50:56,225
[Black Speech]  Gorosh!
[English]  Louder!

1066
01:50:56,226 --> 01:50:57,526
[Black Speech]  Katmuda!
[English]  Death to men!

1067
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,027
[Black Speech]  Gorosh!
[English]  Louder!

1068
01:50:58,028 --> 01:50:59,328
[Black Speech]  Katmuda!
[English]  Death to men!

1069
01:50:59,329 --> 01:51:00,829
[Black Speech]  Gorosh chadar!
[English]  Loud enough!

1070
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,663
What is it?

1071
01:51:25,838 --> 01:51:27,380
What do you see?

1072
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:29,754
I see shapes of men.

1073
01:51:32,428 --> 01:51:33,803
And of horses.

1074
01:51:34,555 --> 01:51:35,753
Where?

1075
01:51:35,931 --> 01:51:38,885
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1076
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,517
Spears rise...

1077
01:51:44,147 --> 01:51:47,599
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1078
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:51,018
The Dead are following.

1079
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,733
They have been summoned.

1080
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:56,234
The Dead?

1081
01:51:56,618 --> 01:51:58,326
Summoned?

1082
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,619
I knew that.

1083
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:05,702
Very good.

1084
01:52:06,419 --> 01:52:08,495
Very good! Legolas!

1085
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:47,868
Do not look down.

1086
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:45,594
Who enters my domain?

1087
01:53:49,353 --> 01:53:51,558
One who will have your allegiance.

1088
01:53:54,523 --> 01:53:59,862
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1089
01:54:00,196 --> 01:54:02,865
You will suffer me.

1090
01:54:26,387 --> 01:54:29,757
The way is shut.

1091
01:54:30,934 --> 01:54:35,394
It was made by those who are dead.

1092
01:54:35,772 --> 01:54:39,935
And the Dead keep it.

1093
01:54:49,076 --> 01:54:52,161
The way is shut.

1094
01:54:53,915 --> 01:54:56,536
Now you must die.

1095
01:55:00,421 --> 01:55:03,256
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1096
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:08,548
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1097
01:55:14,143 --> 01:55:16,300
That line was broken.

1098
01:55:18,939 --> 01:55:21,145
It has been remade.

1099
01:55:29,073 --> 01:55:30,616
Fight for us...

1100
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:33,322
and regain your honor.

1101
01:55:37,498 --> 01:55:38,827
What say you?

1102
01:55:51,053 --> 01:55:52,595
What say you?

1103
01:55:53,347 --> 01:55:55,139
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1104
01:55:55,308 --> 01:55:58,474
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1105
01:55:58,978 --> 01:56:01,469
I am Isildur's heir.

1106
01:56:02,023 --> 01:56:03,979
Fight for me...

1107
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:08,149
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1108
01:56:12,074 --> 01:56:14,031
What say you?

1109
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,165
You have my word!

1110
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:28,459
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1111
01:56:29,925 --> 01:56:31,419
What say you?!

1112
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:37,675
Stand, you traitors!

1113
01:57:04,624 --> 01:57:05,656
Out!

1114
01:57:27,021 --> 01:57:28,599
Legolas!

1115
01:57:29,733 --> 01:57:30,930
Run!

1116
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:39,331
We fight.

1117
01:58:49,685 --> 01:58:52,258
Open the gate! Quick!

1118
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:25,293
Quick! Hurry!

1119
01:59:39,065 --> 01:59:40,690
Faramir!

1120
01:59:41,694 --> 01:59:44,943
Say not that he has fallen.

1121
01:59:46,115 --> 01:59:47,657
They were outnumbered.

1122
01:59:48,074 --> 01:59:49,652
None survived.

1123
01:59:50,368 --> 01:59:52,361
Fear.

1124
01:59:52,913 --> 01:59:56,116
The city is rank with it.

1125
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:00,915
Let us ease their pain.

1126
02:00:01,171 --> 02:00:02,914
Release the prisoners.

1127
02:00:03,089 --> 02:00:05,047
Catapults!

1128
02:00:18,395 --> 02:00:21,847
My sons are spent.

1129
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:25,817
My line has ended.

1130
02:00:28,656 --> 02:00:30,067
He's alive!

1131
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,407
The House of Stewards has failed.

1132
02:00:33,577 --> 02:00:35,035
He needs medicine, my lord.

1133
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,748
My line has ended!

1134
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,243
My lord!

1135
02:00:55,766 --> 02:00:57,592
Rohan...

1136
02:00:58,351 --> 02:01:00,758
has deserted us.

1137
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,403
Theoden's betrayed me.

1138
02:01:29,548 --> 02:01:31,375
Abandon your posts!

1139
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:36,340
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1140
02:01:46,481 --> 02:01:48,023
Prepare for battle!

1141
02:01:48,566 --> 02:01:51,732
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1142
02:01:52,904 --> 02:01:54,861
Over here!

1143
02:01:55,615 --> 02:01:57,987
Return to your posts!

1144
02:02:08,794 --> 02:02:11,415
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1145
02:02:21,598 --> 02:02:23,057
Stay where you are.

1146
02:02:40,032 --> 02:02:41,443
We need more rubble!

1147
02:02:41,617 --> 02:02:43,491
Watch out!

1148
02:02:43,661 --> 02:02:46,199
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1149
02:02:48,082 --> 02:02:49,624
Double up, men!

1150
02:03:58,609 --> 02:04:01,610
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1151
02:04:02,113 --> 02:04:05,611
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1152
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,904
Not at the towers!

1153
02:04:48,073 --> 02:04:51,074
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1154
02:04:51,827 --> 02:04:53,654
Bring them down!

1155
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:30,819
Fight them back!

1156
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:32,983
Peregrin Took!

1157
02:05:33,868 --> 02:05:37,034
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1158
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,092
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1159
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:22,289
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1160
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:26,249
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1161
02:06:37,596 --> 02:06:40,550
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1162
02:06:40,724 --> 02:06:42,682
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1163
02:06:49,024 --> 02:06:51,431
Get back there and smash it down.

1164
02:06:51,609 --> 02:06:53,602
But nothing can breach it.

1165
02:06:56,531 --> 02:06:58,773
Grond will breach it.

1166
02:07:02,203 --> 02:07:04,279
Bring up the wolf's head.

1167
02:07:07,458 --> 02:07:12,797
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1168
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:16,963
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1169
02:07:18,886 --> 02:07:22,302
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1170
02:07:23,015 --> 02:07:26,680
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1171
02:07:27,102 --> 02:07:31,266
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1172
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,141
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1173
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,873
You may go no further.

1174
02:07:55,313 --> 02:07:57,816
You will not enter Gondor.

1175
02:07:58,441 --> 02:08:00,861
Who are you to deny us passage?

1176
02:08:00,944 --> 02:08:04,906
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.

1177
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:08,243
Mind your aim.

1178
02:08:14,978 --> 02:08:17,523
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1179
02:08:17,731 --> 02:08:19,712
Prepare to be boarded.

1180
02:08:21,485 --> 02:08:22,621
Boarded?

1181
02:08:22,632 --> 02:08:24,613
By you and whose army?

1182
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:27,845
This army.

1183
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:46,509
In there.

1184
02:08:48,595 --> 02:08:50,315
What is this place?

1185
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:58,135
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1186
02:08:59,804 --> 02:09:03,297
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1187
02:09:05,955 --> 02:09:07,676
It's the only way.

1188
02:09:10,283 --> 02:09:12,055
Go in...

1189
02:09:12,535 --> 02:09:14,741
or go back.

1190
02:09:17,581 --> 02:09:20,202
I can't go back.

1191
02:09:33,013 --> 02:09:35,557
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1192
02:09:35,568 --> 02:09:38,515
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1193
02:09:44,118 --> 02:09:45,369
Hurry.

1194
02:09:50,634 --> 02:09:52,198
This way.

1195
02:09:55,222 --> 02:09:56,838
Smeagol?

1196
02:09:57,985 --> 02:09:59,966
Over here.

1197
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:11,436
It's sticky. What is it?

1198
02:10:12,218 --> 02:10:13,938
You will see.

1199
02:10:14,512 --> 02:10:16,389
Oh, yes.

1200
02:10:16,858 --> 02:10:19,722
You will see.

1201
02:10:29,005 --> 02:10:30,569
Smeagol?

1202
02:10:32,342 --> 02:10:33,367
Smeagol!

1203
02:10:35,991 --> 02:10:37,660
Smeagol!

1204
02:10:47,252 --> 02:10:48,709
Sam.

1205
02:12:29,175 --> 02:12:31,490
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1206
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:36,436
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

1207
02:12:37,673 --> 02:12:40,895
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1208
02:12:40,936 --> 02:12:44,528
when all other lights go out.

1209
02:12:44,055 --> 02:12:47,600
[Quenya] Aiya Eärendil, Elenion Ancalima!
[English] Hail Eärendil, Brightest of the Stars!

1210
02:12:44,554 --> 02:12:48,412
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)

1211
02:14:01,035 --> 02:14:03,852
Naughty little fly.

1212
02:14:04,476 --> 02:14:07,813
Why does he cry?

1213
02:14:08,230 --> 02:14:11,410
Caught in a web

1214
02:14:11,827 --> 02:14:14,037
Soon you'll be...

1215
02:14:14,413 --> 02:14:16,240
Eaten.

1216
02:14:54,369 --> 02:14:56,287
Got away, did it, precious?

1217
02:14:56,715 --> 02:14:58,487
Not this time.

1218
02:14:58,696 --> 02:15:01,665
- Not this time!
- No!

1219
02:15:08,966 --> 02:15:11,841
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1220
02:15:12,772 --> 02:15:15,327
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

1221
02:15:15,483 --> 02:15:17,006
We promised.

1222
02:15:17,464 --> 02:15:19,914
You must believe us.

1223
02:15:20,019 --> 02:15:21,560
It was the precious.

1224
02:15:22,365 --> 02:15:26,521
The precious made us do it.

1225
02:15:43,948 --> 02:15:46,543
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

1226
02:15:55,991 --> 02:15:58,887
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1227
02:16:09,338 --> 02:16:10,395
No!

1228
02:16:33,945 --> 02:16:36,040
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1229
02:16:40,931 --> 02:16:43,087
I'm so sorry.

1230
02:17:09,396 --> 02:17:13,661
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

1231
02:17:15,183 --> 02:17:17,321
If you do not find a way...

1232
02:17:18,833 --> 02:17:20,449
no one will.

1233
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:56,295
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1234
02:17:56,786 --> 02:17:58,752
The lower level's in flames.

1235
02:17:59,497 --> 02:18:01,671
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

1236
02:18:02,469 --> 02:18:03,668
Time is against us.

1237
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:04,965
Make ready!

1238
02:18:05,232 --> 02:18:06,965
Take heart, Merry.

1239
02:18:07,318 --> 02:18:09,351
It will soon be over.

1240
02:18:10,414 --> 02:18:11,645
My lady...

1241
02:18:12,395 --> 02:18:14,773
you are fair and brave...

1242
02:18:15,294 --> 02:18:17,536
and have much to live for...

1243
02:18:19,152 --> 02:18:21,184
and many who love you.

1244
02:18:24,366 --> 02:18:26,700
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1245
02:18:27,859 --> 02:18:30,446
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

1246
02:18:31,821 --> 02:18:35,418
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

1247
02:18:35,419 --> 02:18:38,371
But
- I'm not.

1248
02:18:38,807 --> 02:18:40,381
I'm a Hobbit.

1249
02:18:43,530 --> 02:18:45,595
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1250
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:51,298
I just want to help my friends.

1251
02:18:53,717 --> 02:18:54,888
Frodo.

1252
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:57,479
Sam.

1253
02:18:59,556 --> 02:19:01,106
Pippin.

1254
02:19:02,893 --> 02:19:06,125
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

1255
02:19:10,087 --> 02:19:12,152
Prepare to move out!

1256
02:19:12,527 --> 02:19:15,770
Make haste. We ride through the night.

1257
02:19:32,192 --> 02:19:33,183
To battle.

1258
02:19:33,860 --> 02:19:35,164
To battle.

1259
02:19:58,468 --> 02:19:59,832
Back to the gate!

1260
02:20:00,553 --> 02:20:02,284
Hurry!

1261
02:20:22,450 --> 02:20:26,685
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

1262
02:20:27,142 --> 02:20:29,331
Thus have I walked.

1263
02:20:30,791 --> 02:20:33,711
And thus now will I sleep.

1264
02:20:39,915 --> 02:20:41,704
Gondor is lost.

1265
02:20:42,417 --> 02:20:45,618
There is no hope for Men.

1266
02:21:00,768 --> 02:21:03,061
Why do the fools fly?

1267
02:21:04,991 --> 02:21:07,690
Better to die sooner than late.

1268
02:21:10,152 --> 02:21:11,895
For die we must.

1269
02:21:24,542 --> 02:21:27,878
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

1270
02:21:28,712 --> 02:21:34,239
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1271
02:21:34,916 --> 02:21:39,545
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

1272
02:21:43,675 --> 02:21:45,053
Bring wood and oil.

1273
02:21:48,315 --> 02:21:49,225
Steady.

1274
02:21:49,931 --> 02:21:51,439
Steady.

1275
02:22:06,301 --> 02:22:08,595
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1276
02:22:09,116 --> 02:22:13,443
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

1277
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:20,721
Run!

1278
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:24,444
Volley!

1279
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:26,766
Fire!

1280
02:24:20,443 --> 02:24:22,163
Let him go, you filth.

1281
02:24:24,217 --> 02:24:25,604
Let him go!

1282
02:24:27,220 --> 02:24:29,305
You will not touch him again.

1283
02:24:32,590 --> 02:24:34,050
Come on and finish it.

1284
02:26:24,209 --> 02:26:25,333
Back!

1285
02:26:36,565 --> 02:26:37,712
Mr. Frodo.

1286
02:26:47,513 --> 02:26:48,974
Oh, no.

1287
02:26:49,599 --> 02:26:51,107
Frodo.

1288
02:26:51,736 --> 02:26:53,276
Mr. Frodo.

1289
02:26:58,222 --> 02:26:59,348
Wake up.

1290
02:27:03,466 --> 02:27:05,604
Don't leave me here alone.

1291
02:27:07,429 --> 02:27:09,566
Don't go where I can't follow.

1292
02:27:13,998 --> 02:27:15,145
Wake up.

1293
02:27:22,078 --> 02:27:24,007
Not asleep.

1294
02:27:26,353 --> 02:27:28,074
Dead.

1295
02:27:46,999 --> 02:27:48,875
You get back, you scum!

1296
02:27:58,312 --> 02:27:59,876
What's this?

1297
02:28:00,731 --> 02:28:03,629
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

1298
02:28:05,454 --> 02:28:07,800
Killed another one, has she?

1299
02:28:08,113 --> 02:28:09,938
No.

1300
02:28:12,857 --> 02:28:14,958
This fellow ain't dead.

1301
02:28:14,963 --> 02:28:17,132
Not dead?

1302
02:28:17,653 --> 02:28:23,075
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1303
02:28:23,753 --> 02:28:26,360
Then she has her way with them.

1304
02:28:26,933 --> 02:28:28,967
That's how she likes to feed.

1305
02:28:29,123 --> 02:28:31,052
Fresh blood.

1306
02:28:31,261 --> 02:28:33,450
Get him to the tower!

1307
02:28:37,152 --> 02:28:38,903
Samwise, you fool.

1308
02:28:38,945 --> 02:28:41,792
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

1309
02:28:42,104 --> 02:28:44,346
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1310
02:29:08,849 --> 02:29:11,873
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1311
02:29:13,229 --> 02:29:14,480
He is burning.

1312
02:29:15,783 --> 02:29:17,139
Already burning.

1313
02:29:17,504 --> 02:29:19,068
He's not dead.

1314
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:21,414
He's not dead!

1315
02:29:23,499 --> 02:29:25,176
No! No!

1316
02:29:25,689 --> 02:29:27,670
No! No!

1317
02:29:28,139 --> 02:29:30,120
He's not dead!

1318
02:29:30,641 --> 02:29:33,926
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1319
02:29:34,134 --> 02:29:37,263
I release you from my service.

1320
02:29:38,618 --> 02:29:42,945
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

1321
02:29:45,302 --> 02:29:47,356
Pour oil on the wood!

1322
02:29:49,253 --> 02:29:51,116
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1323
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:54,538
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1324
02:29:55,197 --> 02:29:56,448
Where is Gandalf?

1325
02:29:57,908 --> 02:29:58,950
Gandalf!

1326
02:30:04,737 --> 02:30:05,780
Retreat!

1327
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:09,690
The city is breached!

1328
02:30:09,846 --> 02:30:12,766
Fall back! To the second level!

1329
02:30:16,624 --> 02:30:18,396
Get the women and children out!

1330
02:30:18,501 --> 02:30:20,169
Get them out!

1331
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:21,785
Retreat!

1332
02:30:21,889 --> 02:30:23,871
Come on. Come on, move.

1333
02:30:24,079 --> 02:30:28,406
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1334
02:30:36,487 --> 02:30:38,729
Take them down!

1335
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:02,346
Fight! Fight to the last man!

1336
02:31:02,502 --> 02:31:04,014
Fight for your lives!

1337
02:31:04,424 --> 02:31:05,357
Gandalf!

1338
02:31:09,613 --> 02:31:10,791
Gandalf!

1339
02:31:10,896 --> 02:31:13,555
Denethor has lost his mind!

1340
02:31:13,763 --> 02:31:15,953
He's burning Faramir alive!

1341
02:31:15,994 --> 02:31:17,934
Up! Quickly!

1342
02:31:25,024 --> 02:31:26,223
Go back to the abyss.

1343
02:31:28,048 --> 02:31:31,384
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

1344
02:31:31,737 --> 02:31:38,058
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

1345
02:31:38,266 --> 02:31:42,302
This is my hour.

1346
02:31:52,551 --> 02:31:53,541
Gandalf!

1347
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:06,002
You have failed.

1348
02:32:07,065 --> 02:32:11,945
The world of Men will fall.

1349
02:33:09,136 --> 02:33:10,230
Courage, Merry.

1350
02:33:10,804 --> 02:33:12,890
Courage for our friends.

1351
02:33:16,717 --> 02:33:19,845
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1352
02:33:19,876 --> 02:33:23,056
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1353
02:33:31,293 --> 02:33:34,473
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

1354
02:33:34,713 --> 02:33:35,777
Flank ready.

1355
02:33:36,246 --> 02:33:38,696
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

1356
02:33:38,853 --> 02:33:42,659
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

1357
02:33:42,971 --> 02:33:45,370
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1358
02:33:45,787 --> 02:33:49,436
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

1359
02:33:49,811 --> 02:33:54,962
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

1360
02:33:55,275 --> 02:33:58,768
a sword-day, a red day...

1361
02:33:59,091 --> 02:34:02,445
and the sun rises!

1362
02:34:10,498 --> 02:34:14,982
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

1363
02:34:21,186 --> 02:34:23,219
Ride now!

1364
02:34:24,731 --> 02:34:26,593
Ride now!

1365
02:34:27,442 --> 02:34:30,257
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1366
02:34:30,466 --> 02:34:33,646
and the world's ending!

1367
02:34:35,053 --> 02:34:38,964
- Death!
- Death!

1368
02:34:40,058 --> 02:34:43,134
- Death!
- Death!

1369
02:34:43,906 --> 02:34:45,741
- Death!
- Death!

1370
02:34:46,158 --> 02:34:50,433
- Death!
- Death!

1371
02:34:54,552 --> 02:34:57,054
For Eorlingas!

1372
02:35:40,169 --> 02:35:41,473
Fire!

1373
02:35:45,695 --> 02:35:47,520
Death!

1374
02:35:51,065 --> 02:35:52,786
Charge!

1375
02:35:52,838 --> 02:35:53,925
Fire at will!

1376
02:36:51,906 --> 02:36:54,773
Set a fire in our flesh.

1377
02:37:12,676 --> 02:37:14,324
Stay this madness!

1378
02:37:18,745 --> 02:37:23,082
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

1379
02:37:23,718 --> 02:37:27,253
but against the power that has risen in the east...

1380
02:37:27,618 --> 02:37:30,485
there is no victory.

1381
02:38:00,045 --> 02:38:01,714
No!

1382
02:38:01,776 --> 02:38:04,633
You will not take my son from me!

1383
02:38:04,664 --> 02:38:06,771
No!

1384
02:38:17,980 --> 02:38:19,387
Faramir.

1385
02:38:33,203 --> 02:38:36,904
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1386
02:39:04,848 --> 02:39:06,934
Drive them to the river!

1387
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,574
Make safe the city!

1388
02:39:51,352 --> 02:39:53,072
Re-form the line!

1389
02:39:54,272 --> 02:39:56,148
Re-form the line!

1390
02:40:03,343 --> 02:40:06,106
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1391
02:40:06,575 --> 02:40:08,765
Charge!

1392
02:41:27,592 --> 02:41:28,843
Cut him down!

1393
02:41:55,849 --> 02:41:58,299
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1394
02:42:00,697 --> 02:42:01,792
Left!

1395
02:42:19,570 --> 02:42:21,030
Aim for their heads!

1396
02:42:27,077 --> 02:42:30,414
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

1397
02:42:36,096 --> 02:42:37,035
Merry!

1398
02:42:44,281 --> 02:42:45,689
Merry!

1399
02:43:59,146 --> 02:44:01,075
I didn't think it would end this way.

1400
02:44:02,431 --> 02:44:03,890
End?

1401
02:44:05,267 --> 02:44:07,488
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1402
02:44:09,771 --> 02:44:12,701
Death is just another path...

1403
02:44:13,567 --> 02:44:15,569
one that we all must take.

1404
02:44:16,538 --> 02:44:20,104
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

1405
02:44:20,208 --> 02:44:23,649
and all turns to silver glass.

1406
02:44:25,943 --> 02:44:27,716
And then you see it.

1407
02:44:29,634 --> 02:44:32,147
What, Gandalf?

1408
02:44:33,315 --> 02:44:34,754
See what?

1409
02:44:35,875 --> 02:44:37,882
White shores...

1410
02:44:39,759 --> 02:44:42,001
and beyond.

1411
02:44:43,565 --> 02:44:45,441
A far green country...

1412
02:44:46,203 --> 02:44:48,934
under a swift sunrise.

1413
02:44:53,105 --> 02:44:54,826
Well...

1414
02:44:54,878 --> 02:44:56,442
that isn't so bad.

1415
02:44:56,463 --> 02:44:57,745
No.

1416
02:45:00,091 --> 02:45:01,707
No, it isn't.

1417
02:45:18,025 --> 02:45:21,414
Rally to me! To me!

1418
02:45:42,372 --> 02:45:46,751
Feast on his flesh.

1419
02:45:51,183 --> 02:45:53,320
I will kill you if you touch him.

1420
02:45:53,331 --> 02:45:58,847
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

1421
02:47:07,820 --> 02:47:11,209
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1422
02:47:11,443 --> 02:47:13,242
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1423
02:47:13,294 --> 02:47:17,113
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1424
02:47:32,245 --> 02:47:34,621
There's plenty for the both of us.

1425
02:47:34,721 --> 02:47:37,067
May the best Dwarf win.

1426
02:47:54,428 --> 02:47:56,655
You fool.

1427
02:47:56,826 --> 02:48:00,242
No man can kill me.

1428
02:48:02,613 --> 02:48:05,790
Die now.

1429
02:48:16,429 --> 02:48:18,463
I am no man.

1430
02:48:34,989 --> 02:48:38,488
- 15! 16!
- 17!

1431
02:48:46,291 --> 02:48:48,201
Merry!

1432
02:49:30,209 --> 02:49:32,001
Legolas!

1433
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:56,772
33, 34.

1434
02:50:43,865 --> 02:50:46,237
That still only counts as one!

1435
02:50:46,367 --> 02:50:48,567
Come on, then. Come on!

1436
02:51:32,287 --> 02:51:35,122
I know your face...

1437
02:51:36,906 --> 02:51:38,827
Eowyn.

1438
02:51:41,421 --> 02:51:43,793
My eyes darken.

1439
02:51:44,883 --> 02:51:46,321
No.

1440
02:51:47,135 --> 02:51:48,824
No.

1441
02:51:50,831 --> 02:51:53,338
I am going to save you.

1442
02:51:54,663 --> 02:51:57,009
You already did.

1443
02:52:00,690 --> 02:52:02,314
Eowyn...

1444
02:52:03,766 --> 02:52:06,309
my body is broken.

1445
02:52:11,320 --> 02:52:13,822
You have to let me go.

1446
02:52:19,687 --> 02:52:22,282
I go to my fathers...

1447
02:52:23,733 --> 02:52:26,589
in whose mighty company...

1448
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:30,382
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1449
02:52:46,954 --> 02:52:48,609
Eowyn.

1450
02:53:35,074 --> 02:53:37,571
Release us.

1451
02:53:39,427 --> 02:53:41,202
Bad idea.

1452
02:53:41,356 --> 02:53:45,083
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1453
02:53:45,109 --> 02:53:47,368
You gave us your word.

1454
02:53:49,045 --> 02:53:51,235
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1455
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:53,919
Go.

1456
02:53:54,624 --> 02:53:56,461
Be at peace.

1457
02:54:39,762 --> 02:54:41,701
Merry.

1458
02:54:42,275 --> 02:54:45,611
No!

1459
02:54:49,156 --> 02:54:51,919
No!

1460
02:55:15,568 --> 02:55:19,498
With a sigh.

1461
02:55:19,613 --> 02:55:23,376
You turn away.

1462
02:55:23,513 --> 02:55:27,548
With a deepening heart.

1463
02:55:27,579 --> 02:55:32,480
No more words to say.

1464
02:55:32,605 --> 02:55:36,129
You will find.

1465
02:55:36,181 --> 02:55:44,679
That the world has changed forever.

1466
02:56:09,370 --> 02:56:17,180
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

1467
02:56:21,048 --> 02:56:25,865
And the sun is now fading.

1468
02:56:25,970 --> 02:56:36,042
I wish I could hold you closer.

1469
02:56:38,873 --> 02:56:40,150
Merry!

1470
02:56:41,693 --> 02:56:43,800
Merry!

1471
02:56:55,144 --> 02:56:56,971
Merry.

1472
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:00,685
Merry, it's me.

1473
02:57:03,298 --> 02:57:04,861
It's Pippin.

1474
02:57:07,364 --> 02:57:09,653
I knew you'd find me.

1475
02:57:09,825 --> 02:57:11,023
Yes.

1476
02:57:13,454 --> 02:57:15,530
Are you going to leave me?

1477
02:57:16,081 --> 02:57:17,789
No, Merry.

1478
02:57:19,084 --> 02:57:21,326
I'm going to look after you.

1479
02:58:05,025 --> 02:58:06,748
Hands off!

1480
02:58:06,902 --> 02:58:10,089
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1481
02:58:10,342 --> 02:58:14,506
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1482
02:58:16,025 --> 02:58:19,935
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

1483
02:58:20,717 --> 02:58:25,878
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1484
02:58:46,367 --> 02:58:48,296
The scum tried to knife me.

1485
02:58:48,348 --> 02:58:50,290
Kill him!

1486
03:00:33,451 --> 03:00:35,517
That's for Frodo!

1487
03:00:35,797 --> 03:00:38,024
And for the Shire!

1488
03:00:41,428 --> 03:00:43,738
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1489
03:01:13,177 --> 03:01:16,563
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1490
03:01:17,661 --> 03:01:22,401
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1491
03:01:29,652 --> 03:01:31,406
Not if I stick you first.

1492
03:01:31,529 --> 03:01:33,093
Sam!

1493
03:01:38,150 --> 03:01:40,235
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1494
03:01:40,287 --> 03:01:42,420
Sorry for everything.

1495
03:01:42,633 --> 03:01:46,590
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1496
03:01:46,700 --> 03:01:49,633
They've taken it. Sam...

1497
03:01:50,401 --> 03:01:51,927
they took the Ring.

1498
03:01:52,643 --> 03:01:55,389
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1499
03:02:07,345 --> 03:02:09,572
I thought I'd lost you.

1500
03:02:09,952 --> 03:02:11,659
So I took it.

1501
03:02:12,819 --> 03:02:14,905
Only for safekeeping.

1502
03:02:16,156 --> 03:02:17,909
Give it to me.

1503
03:02:21,421 --> 03:02:23,669
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1504
03:02:28,303 --> 03:02:29,589
Sam.

1505
03:02:31,170 --> 03:02:33,138
Give me the Ring.

1506
03:02:53,849 --> 03:02:55,150
You must understand.

1507
03:02:58,645 --> 03:03:00,493
The Ring is my burden.

1508
03:03:01,669 --> 03:03:03,827
It will destroy you, Sam.

1509
03:03:06,986 --> 03:03:08,964
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1510
03:03:10,271 --> 03:03:11,927
We best find you some clothes.

1511
03:03:12,096 --> 03:03:15,132
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

1512
03:03:36,870 --> 03:03:39,076
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1513
03:03:39,581 --> 03:03:41,869
We made it to Mordor.

1514
03:03:43,209 --> 03:03:44,869
There are so many of them.

1515
03:03:45,837 --> 03:03:48,410
We'll never get through unseen.

1516
03:03:53,542 --> 03:03:56,886
It's him, the Eye.

1517
03:04:04,605 --> 03:04:07,227
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1518
03:04:07,692 --> 03:04:09,731
There's nothing for it.

1519
03:04:12,738 --> 03:04:17,151
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

1520
03:04:26,335 --> 03:04:29,752
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1521
03:04:31,027 --> 03:04:33,894
The darkness is deepening.

1522
03:04:33,946 --> 03:04:36,240
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1523
03:04:36,251 --> 03:04:38,676
It's only a matter of time.

1524
03:04:40,150 --> 03:04:42,589
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

1525
03:04:43,643 --> 03:04:48,127
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

1526
03:04:48,283 --> 03:04:50,056
Let him stay there.

1527
03:04:50,066 --> 03:04:52,944
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1528
03:04:53,007 --> 03:04:58,345
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1529
03:05:05,018 --> 03:05:07,572
I've sent him to his death.

1530
03:05:09,085 --> 03:05:10,407
No.

1531
03:05:10,910 --> 03:05:13,328
There is still hope for Frodo.

1532
03:05:13,673 --> 03:05:17,801
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1533
03:05:18,886 --> 03:05:21,459
- We can give him that.
- How?

1534
03:05:21,806 --> 03:05:24,510
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1535
03:05:24,673 --> 03:05:26,806
Empty his lands.

1536
03:05:27,019 --> 03:05:30,103
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1537
03:05:30,668 --> 03:05:33,732
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

1538
03:05:33,901 --> 03:05:35,478
Not for ourselves.

1539
03:05:35,673 --> 03:05:41,281
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1540
03:05:43,076 --> 03:05:46,860
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1541
03:05:47,612 --> 03:05:48,821
A diversion.

1542
03:05:48,968 --> 03:05:50,790
Certainty of death...

1543
03:05:50,897 --> 03:05:53,711
small chance of success...

1544
03:05:54,546 --> 03:05:56,165
what are we waiting for?

1545
03:05:56,736 --> 03:05:59,164
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1546
03:05:59,968 --> 03:06:02,007
He will not take the bait.

1547
03:06:03,513 --> 03:06:06,004
Oh, I think he will.

1548
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:43,031
Long have you hunted me.

1549
03:06:43,239 --> 03:06:45,220
Long have I eluded you.

1550
03:06:46,837 --> 03:06:48,633
No more.

1551
03:06:50,278 --> 03:06:52,758
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1552
03:07:37,250 --> 03:07:39,762
The city has fallen silent.

1553
03:07:41,421 --> 03:07:44,478
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1554
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:46,987
It grows so cold.

1555
03:07:49,971 --> 03:07:53,028
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

1556
03:07:59,408 --> 03:08:02,621
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

1557
03:08:31,209 --> 03:08:32,825
Look, the Orcs...

1558
03:08:33,295 --> 03:08:35,360
they're moving off.

1559
03:08:36,412 --> 03:08:38,488
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1560
03:08:38,665 --> 03:08:40,990
some luck at last.

1561
03:08:41,167 --> 03:08:42,994
Move it, you slugs!

1562
03:08:44,243 --> 03:08:47,664
Come on! Faster!

1563
03:08:55,556 --> 03:08:58,788
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

1564
03:08:58,799 --> 03:09:03,348
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1565
03:09:06,192 --> 03:09:07,860
Come on!

1566
03:09:08,027 --> 03:09:10,238
What have I told you?

1567
03:09:10,258 --> 03:09:12,552
No evation...

1568
03:09:13,542 --> 03:09:15,367
Now move it!

1569
03:09:17,192 --> 03:09:18,696
Get up!

1570
03:09:19,069 --> 03:09:21,748
Come on, you slugs!

1571
03:09:21,884 --> 03:09:25,533
You two are going straight to the front line!

1572
03:09:25,711 --> 03:09:31,007
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

1573
03:09:43,572 --> 03:09:47,378
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

1574
03:09:56,814 --> 03:10:00,407
Don't you know we're at war?

1575
03:10:22,725 --> 03:10:25,595
Company, halt!

1576
03:10:29,398 --> 03:10:32,808
Inspection!

1577
03:10:32,943 --> 03:10:35,440
Sam, help me.

1578
03:10:35,602 --> 03:10:37,439
Mr. Frodo!

1579
03:10:40,137 --> 03:10:42,696
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1580
03:10:42,848 --> 03:10:44,696
It's so heavy.

1581
03:10:53,797 --> 03:10:55,001
Oh, no.

1582
03:11:00,626 --> 03:11:02,629
What do I do? What do we do?

1583
03:11:05,683 --> 03:11:06,846
- Hit me.
- What?

1584
03:11:06,987 --> 03:11:09,057
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1585
03:11:09,228 --> 03:11:10,806
Get off of me!

1586
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:13,806
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1587
03:11:22,418 --> 03:11:24,489
Get off of me!

1588
03:11:25,390 --> 03:11:27,320
Break it up! Break it up!

1589
03:11:29,874 --> 03:11:34,494
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

1590
03:11:34,514 --> 03:11:36,953
Go, Sam. Now!

1591
03:11:45,879 --> 03:11:47,431
Move along, scum!

1592
03:11:47,599 --> 03:11:49,508
Back in the line!

1593
03:11:49,997 --> 03:11:51,810
You maggots!

1594
03:11:52,448 --> 03:11:55,480
Get back into the line, you slugs!

1595
03:11:57,818 --> 03:12:01,352
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1596
03:12:50,056 --> 03:12:52,200
I can't...

1597
03:12:52,350 --> 03:12:56,119
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1598
03:12:56,208 --> 03:12:57,448
It's... It's...

1599
03:12:57,616 --> 03:13:00,199
It's such a weight to carry.

1600
03:13:01,056 --> 03:13:02,119
It's...

1601
03:13:02,256 --> 03:13:04,254
Such a weight.

1602
03:13:09,189 --> 03:13:11,692
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

1603
03:13:13,047 --> 03:13:16,280
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

1604
03:13:31,346 --> 03:13:33,277
Mr. Frodo.

1605
03:13:34,735 --> 03:13:36,281
Look.

1606
03:13:38,750 --> 03:13:40,701
There is light...

1607
03:13:41,043 --> 03:13:42,607
and beauty up there...

1608
03:13:42,868 --> 03:13:45,337
that no shadow can touch.

1609
03:14:36,358 --> 03:14:38,014
Take mine.

1610
03:14:38,495 --> 03:14:40,639
There's a few drops left.

1611
03:14:55,804 --> 03:14:58,440
There will be none left for the return journey.

1612
03:14:59,349 --> 03:15:02,537
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1613
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:38,400
[Black Speech]  Kelkum-ishi.
[English]  In the coldness.

1614
03:15:55,393 --> 03:15:57,583
Frodo, get down!

1615
03:15:59,303 --> 03:16:01,254
Hide!

1616
03:16:11,399 --> 03:16:13,438
Frodo!

1617
03:16:19,219 --> 03:16:20,692
Where are they?

1618
03:16:56,755 --> 03:16:59,813
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1619
03:17:00,718 --> 03:17:03,574
Let justice be done upon him!

1620
03:17:47,013 --> 03:17:51,025
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

1621
03:17:56,866 --> 03:18:00,577
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

1622
03:18:00,933 --> 03:18:04,084
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1623
03:18:04,217 --> 03:18:06,772
faithless and accursed.

1624
03:18:06,782 --> 03:18:10,786
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

1625
03:18:10,890 --> 03:18:13,706
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

1626
03:18:14,644 --> 03:18:17,224
Old Greybeard.

1627
03:18:18,554 --> 03:18:22,942
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

1628
03:18:27,949 --> 03:18:29,277
Frodo.

1629
03:18:32,119 --> 03:18:33,578
Frodo.

1630
03:18:34,299 --> 03:18:35,778
- Silence.
- No!

1631
03:18:36,384 --> 03:18:37,952
Silence!

1632
03:18:39,721 --> 03:18:43,500
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1633
03:18:44,413 --> 03:18:48,587
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

1634
03:18:53,953 --> 03:18:59,853
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

1635
03:19:02,451 --> 03:19:04,605
And he did, Gandalf.

1636
03:19:04,745 --> 03:19:06,520
He did.

1637
03:19:13,452 --> 03:19:15,029
And who is this?

1638
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:17,279
Isildur's heir?

1639
03:19:17,414 --> 03:19:20,456
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1640
03:19:25,182 --> 03:19:27,786
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1641
03:19:29,926 --> 03:19:31,124
I do not believe it.

1642
03:19:33,106 --> 03:19:34,513
I will not.

1643
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
[Black Speech]  Ash nazg durb!
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1644
03:19:50,571 --> 03:19:52,404
Pull back.

1645
03:19:52,656 --> 03:19:54,738
Pull back!

1646
03:19:56,200 --> 03:19:58,200
[Black Speech]  Ash nazg durb!
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1647
03:20:06,941 --> 03:20:09,002
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1648
03:20:10,903 --> 03:20:14,449
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

1649
03:20:14,553 --> 03:20:16,469
Something's drawn its gaze.

1650
03:20:30,324 --> 03:20:32,324
[Black Speech]  Ash nazg durb!
[English]  One Ring to rule!

1651
03:20:33,947 --> 03:20:36,740
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1652
03:20:38,587 --> 03:20:42,824
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1653
03:20:45,625 --> 03:20:47,582
I see in your eyes...

1654
03:20:47,919 --> 03:20:52,005
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

1655
03:20:53,966 --> 03:20:57,720
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

1656
03:20:57,741 --> 03:21:01,339
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

1657
03:21:01,369 --> 03:21:04,185
But it is not this day.

1658
03:21:04,445 --> 03:21:07,513
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1659
03:21:07,678 --> 03:21:10,559
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1660
03:21:10,701 --> 03:21:13,188
But it is not this day.

1661
03:21:13,360 --> 03:21:15,020
This day we fight!

1662
03:21:17,114 --> 03:21:21,154
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

1663
03:21:21,326 --> 03:21:25,573
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1664
03:22:54,032 --> 03:22:57,577
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1665
03:22:58,046 --> 03:23:00,371
What about side by side with a friend?

1666
03:23:03,885 --> 03:23:05,670
Aye.

1667
03:23:06,492 --> 03:23:08,304
I could do that.

1668
03:23:38,606 --> 03:23:40,703
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1669
03:23:43,663 --> 03:23:45,916
It'll be spring soon.

1670
03:23:46,687 --> 03:23:49,423
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1671
03:23:49,555 --> 03:23:53,261
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

1672
03:23:54,612 --> 03:23:58,641
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

1673
03:23:59,669 --> 03:24:04,067
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

1674
03:24:05,977 --> 03:24:08,478
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1675
03:24:10,043 --> 03:24:11,783
No, Sam.

1676
03:24:11,920 --> 03:24:14,905
I can't recall the taste of food...

1677
03:24:16,039 --> 03:24:19,324
nor the sound of water...

1678
03:24:19,480 --> 03:24:23,083
nor the touch of grass.

1679
03:24:24,015 --> 03:24:25,589
I'm...

1680
03:24:26,466 --> 03:24:27,841
naked in the dark.

1681
03:24:29,489 --> 03:24:31,799
There's... there's nothing.

1682
03:24:31,940 --> 03:24:36,680
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1683
03:24:37,935 --> 03:24:39,844
I can see him...

1684
03:24:40,229 --> 03:24:41,931
with my waking eyes.

1685
03:24:42,940 --> 03:24:45,437
Then let us be rid of it...

1686
03:24:46,016 --> 03:24:48,268
once and for all.

1687
03:24:48,988 --> 03:24:51,064
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1688
03:24:51,229 --> 03:24:53,861
I can't carry it for you...

1689
03:24:54,253 --> 03:24:56,324
but I can carry you.

1690
03:24:56,860 --> 03:24:58,614
Come on!

1691
03:25:29,027 --> 03:25:31,981
Aragorn.

1692
03:25:43,520 --> 03:25:47,274
Elessar.

1693
03:25:58,118 --> 03:26:00,546
For Frodo.

1694
03:26:35,498 --> 03:26:37,003
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1695
03:26:37,688 --> 03:26:39,925
A doorway.

1696
03:26:40,503 --> 03:26:42,173
We're almost there.

1697
03:26:44,517 --> 03:26:48,467
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1698
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:04,070
Mustn't go that way.

1699
03:27:05,579 --> 03:27:08,077
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1700
03:27:08,238 --> 03:27:09,992
You swore!

1701
03:27:10,167 --> 03:27:12,243
You swore on the precious!

1702
03:27:14,129 --> 03:27:16,087
Smeagol promised!

1703
03:27:16,997 --> 03:27:19,000
Smeagol lied.

1704
03:28:11,477 --> 03:28:13,393
Frodo!

1705
03:28:40,464 --> 03:28:42,249
Eagles.

1706
03:28:43,644 --> 03:28:45,169
The eagles are coming!

1707
03:29:07,991 --> 03:29:09,864
Frodo!

1708
03:29:15,081 --> 03:29:16,403
I'm here, Sam.

1709
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:25,506
Destroy it!

1710
03:29:36,039 --> 03:29:39,345
Go on! Now!

1711
03:29:39,480 --> 03:29:42,059
Throw it in the fire!

1712
03:29:55,433 --> 03:29:58,123
What are you waiting for?

1713
03:29:59,969 --> 03:30:02,372
Just let it go!

1714
03:30:35,576 --> 03:30:37,818
The Ring is mine.

1715
03:30:41,363 --> 03:30:43,117
No.

1716
03:30:43,501 --> 03:30:44,823
No.

1717
03:30:53,250 --> 03:30:55,929
No!

1718
03:32:40,334 --> 03:32:42,239
Yes!

1719
03:32:43,410 --> 03:32:45,117
Yes!

1720
03:32:46,225 --> 03:32:49,116
Precious! Precious!

1721
03:32:49,249 --> 03:32:52,457
Precious! Precious!

1722
03:33:45,345 --> 03:33:47,214
Give me your hand!

1723
03:33:55,563 --> 03:33:57,971
Take my hand!

1724
03:34:00,620 --> 03:34:01,980
No!

1725
03:34:09,223 --> 03:34:11,200
Don't you let go.

1726
03:34:15,791 --> 03:34:17,369
Don't let go.

1727
03:34:18,972 --> 03:34:20,462
Reach!

1728
03:35:49,633 --> 03:35:52,504
Frodo!

1729
03:35:53,074 --> 03:35:56,096
Frodo!

1730
03:37:17,427 --> 03:37:19,296
It's gone.

1731
03:37:23,735 --> 03:37:25,510
It's done.

1732
03:37:25,977 --> 03:37:28,012
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1733
03:37:29,366 --> 03:37:31,805
It's over now.

1734
03:37:57,466 --> 03:37:59,838
I can see the Shire.

1735
03:38:02,054 --> 03:38:04,379
The Brandywine River.

1736
03:38:06,486 --> 03:38:08,509
Bag End.

1737
03:38:10,813 --> 03:38:13,559
Gandalf's fireworks.

1738
03:38:13,941 --> 03:38:17,731
The lights in the Party Tree.

1739
03:38:19,206 --> 03:38:22,357
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1740
03:38:23,481 --> 03:38:26,196
She had ribbons in her hair.

1741
03:38:29,112 --> 03:38:32,076
If ever I was to marry someone...

1742
03:38:32,970 --> 03:38:35,243
it would've been her.

1743
03:38:36,671 --> 03:38:38,747
It would've been her.

1744
03:38:50,852 --> 03:38:54,102
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1745
03:38:58,359 --> 03:39:01,318
here at the end of all things.

1746
03:40:50,969 --> 03:40:53,050
Gandalf?

1747
03:41:12,657 --> 03:41:14,691
Frodo!

1748
03:41:34,449 --> 03:41:36,297
Gimli!

1749
03:43:19,239 --> 03:43:23,029
Now come the days of the king.

1750
03:43:27,998 --> 03:43:30,364
May they be blessed.

1751
03:43:50,624 --> 03:43:53,314
This day does not belong to one man...

1752
03:43:53,439 --> 03:43:55,355
but to all.

1753
03:43:56,984 --> 03:43:59,943
Let us together rebuild this world...

1754
03:44:00,112 --> 03:44:04,359
that we may share in the days of peace.

you bow to no one.

1772
03:47:33,029 --> 03:47:35,193
And thus it was.

1773
03:47:35,323 --> 03:47:38,982
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1774
03:47:39,128 --> 03:47:41,698
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1775
03:47:41,839 --> 03:47:46,367
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

1776
03:47:46,531 --> 03:47:48,949
was ended.

1777
03:47:53,935 --> 03:47:58,758
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1778
03:47:58,887 --> 03:48:03,140
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

1779
03:48:05,665 --> 03:48:08,390
We were home.

1780
03:48:14,945 --> 03:48:16,818
Hi.

1781
03:48:33,974 --> 03:48:36,211
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1782
03:49:24,283 --> 03:49:25,882
More of the same, Rosie.

1783
03:49:26,056 --> 03:49:28,048
Good night, lads.

1784
03:50:25,593 --> 03:50:29,612
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

1785
03:50:30,911 --> 03:50:33,159
How do you go on...

1786
03:50:33,309 --> 03:50:38,537
when in your heart you begin to understand...

1787
03:50:39,774 --> 03:50:42,748
there is no going back?

1788
03:50:43,423 --> 03:50:47,130
There are some things that time cannot mend...

1789
03:50:47,594 --> 03:50:50,553
some hurts that go too deep...

1790
03:50:52,286 --> 03:50:55,142
that have taken hold.

1791
03:51:33,263 --> 03:51:35,179
Mr. Frodo?

1792
03:51:38,477 --> 03:51:39,894
What is it?

1793
03:51:41,709 --> 03:51:45,680
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

1794
03:51:46,349 --> 03:51:49,064
It's never really healed.

1795
03:51:53,022 --> 03:51:58,288
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

1796
03:51:58,966 --> 03:52:02,824
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

1797
03:52:03,293 --> 03:52:05,493
You finished it.

1798
03:52:08,350 --> 03:52:09,875
Not quite.

1799
03:52:10,644 --> 03:52:13,255
There's room for a little more.

1800
03:52:15,857 --> 03:52:20,100
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

1801
03:52:20,236 --> 03:52:23,553
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

1802
03:52:24,407 --> 03:52:27,273
Bilbo's story was now over.

1803
03:52:27,744 --> 03:52:30,692
There would be no more journeys for him...

1804
03:52:30,820 --> 03:52:32,403
save one.

1805
03:52:33,114 --> 03:52:36,763
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1806
03:52:36,867 --> 03:52:38,901
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1807
03:52:39,057 --> 03:52:41,782
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

1808
03:52:41,924 --> 03:52:44,577
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

1809
03:52:46,251 --> 03:52:47,953
Frodo...

1810
03:52:49,379 --> 03:52:53,922
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

1811
03:52:54,541 --> 03:52:56,793
The one I gave you.

1812
03:53:00,432 --> 03:53:02,590
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1813
03:53:05,124 --> 03:53:07,766
I'm afraid I lost it.

1814
03:53:07,939 --> 03:53:09,731
Oh.

1815
03:53:10,285 --> 03:53:11,817
Pity.

1816
03:53:14,560 --> 03:53:18,438
I should like to have held it one last time.

1817
03:53:47,561 --> 03:53:52,644
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

1818
03:54:06,799 --> 03:54:10,164
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1819
03:54:10,917 --> 03:54:13,746
The time has come...

1820
03:54:13,889 --> 03:54:17,174
for the dominion of Men.

1821
03:54:16,800 --> 03:54:19,800
[Sindarin] I Aear cân ven na mar.
[English] The sea calls us to home.

1822
03:54:17,695 --> 03:54:21,176
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The sea calls us home.)

1823
03:54:29,581 --> 03:54:31,761
I think I'm...

1824
03:54:31,928 --> 03:54:36,315
quite ready for another adventure.

1825
03:55:07,379 --> 03:55:09,678
Farewell...

1826
03:55:09,829 --> 03:55:12,602
my brave Hobbits.

1827
03:55:14,521 --> 03:55:16,555
My work is now finished.

1828
03:55:20,360 --> 03:55:25,361
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1829
03:55:25,991 --> 03:55:28,868
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1830
03:55:32,403 --> 03:55:34,905
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1831
03:55:35,583 --> 03:55:39,581
for not all tears are an evil.

1832
03:55:57,115 --> 03:55:59,055
It is time, Frodo.

1833
03:56:04,570 --> 03:56:06,604
What does he mean?

1834
03:56:09,054 --> 03:56:11,945
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1835
03:56:13,537 --> 03:56:16,289
And it has been saved.

1836
03:56:19,950 --> 03:56:22,629
But not for me.

1837
03:56:23,547 --> 03:56:26,003
You don't mean that.

1838
03:56:27,196 --> 03:56:29,293
You can't leave.

1839
03:56:37,728 --> 03:56:40,474
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1840
04:00:13,563 --> 04:00:16,434
My dear Sam

1841
04:00:18,360 --> 04:00:21,693
You cannot always be torn in two.

1842
04:00:21,853 --> 04:00:25,991
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

1843
04:00:26,597 --> 04:00:32,199
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

1844
04:00:33,322 --> 04:00:36,624
Your part in the story will go on.

1845
04:00:37,337 --> 04:00:39,122
Well...

1846
04:00:40,986 --> 04:00:42,715
I'm back.
