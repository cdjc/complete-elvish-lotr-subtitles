# Complete subtitles for the Lord of the Rings movies
Complete subtitles for the Lord of the Rings movies with transcription and translation of **all foreign (Elvish, Black Speech, Rohirric, etc.) dialogs** and selected song lyrics.


## General information

This repository contains subtitles for all 3 LotR movies.
These subtitles are unique as they contain **transcriptions (the original language) and English translations of all dialogs in foreign languages** used in the movies - i.e., Sindarin, Quenya, Adûnaic, Rohirric, and Black Speech.
The subtitles also contain transcriptions and translations of selected song lyrics.


## Subtitle versions

For each movie, two types of subtitles are available:
- **Foreign-only**: Subtitles containing only the transcriptions and translations of foreign languages.
- **Full**: Subtitles containing all English dialogs as well as the the transcriptions and translations of foreign languages.


## About dialogs

**All discernable foreign dialogs and monologues** in the movies are included.

Unlike in other translations, I have tried to translate the foreign languages as closely as possible. This sometimes makes the translations sound weird or simple (e.g., "Will be what will be."). However, I feel that this (correctly) shows that the foreign languages are really *foreign* languages, and thus, not everything can be translated directly into English.

I have provided the transcriptions and translations of foreign dialogs even for the dialogs which are translated and hard-coded into the movie as the oficial translations are sometimes not accurate.

For the transcription, I have mostly used the existing resources (see below). However, for some dialogs, I have found no resources on the internet and I had to transcript the dialogs using only my hearing.

*Fellowship of the Ring*: I have discerned all dialogs apart from some of the words said by the ring (e.g., after Gimli smashes the ring with an axe) and some words in the Aragorn-Haldir dialog at the edge of Lothlórien.


## Song lyrics

Only **some selected song lyrics** are included in the subtitles.
Song lyrics are included only if they do not break the immersion and make sense.
Thus, if you hear lyrics but do not see the subtitles, keep calm as they are not so important and you are not missing anything important story-wise.
The lyrics are, thus, usually omitted if:
- someone is speaking over them,
- the song lyrics are strongly irrelevant to the scene,
- the lyrics are sung durign an action scene,
- the lyrics contain only partial words.

*Fellowship of the Ring*: I have included most of the song lyrics, but I have not included the lyrics which overlap with dialogs.

*The Two Towers*: I have not included most of the song lyrics yet. For now, I have included only the lyrics of the funeral song sung by Éowyn. I future, I plan to add more lyrics, but I am not sure when.

*Return of the King*: I have not included most of the song lyrics yet. For now, I have included only the lyrics of the coronation song sung by Aragorn. I future, I plan to add more lyrics, but I am not sure when.


## Resources

My main sources for the transcriptions and translations were:
- Existing subtitles with some non-english dialogs:
  - Funksw's subtitles,
  - LeithioiPhilinn's subtitles,
- [Gwaith-i-Phethdain website](https://www.elvish.org/gwaith/),

## Useful tools

If you want to **merge** my foreign-only subtitles with your own English/other subtitles, I recommend the [subtitletools/Merge Subtitles](https://subtitletools.com/merge-subtitles-online) tool.

If you want to **retime** my subtitles, I recommend the [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) tool.


## Why this project?

I wanted to watch LotR and understand all that is said and sung, but I have not found any complete subtitles. So I have created them myself, and I share them with you so you can enjoy them too :) If you find any mistakes please let me know and I will edit the subtitles.
