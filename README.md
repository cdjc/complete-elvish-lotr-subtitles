# Complete subtitles for the Lord of the Rings movies
Complete subtitles for the Lord of the Rings movies with transcription and translation of **all foreign (Elvish, Black Speech, Rohirric, etc.) dialogs** and selected song lyrics.



## 0) Tip jar
Please know that you enjoying the movies with my subtitles is already a treat enough for me. 
However, if you wanted to help me battle my ADHD and give me some external motivation to finish the subtitles to 100 % quality, feel free to nudge me by a [tip on ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/zoowlcz) <3



## 1) About the subtitles

### 1.1) General information

This repository contains subtitles for all 3 LotR movies.
These subtitles are unique as they contain **transcriptions (the original language) and English translations of all dialogs in foreign languages** used in the movies - i.e., Sindarin, Quenya, Adûnaic, Rohirric, and Black Speech.
The subtitles also contain transcriptions and translations of selected song lyrics.

Though subtitles for all 3 movies are already available, **this is an ongoing project**. Some subtitles are still being revised and improved, see [Current subtitle status](#17-current-subtitle-status).


### 1.2) Subtitle versions

For each movie, two types of subtitles are available:
- **Foreign-only**: Subtitles containing only the transcriptions and translations of foreign languages.
- **Full**: Subtitles containing all English dialogs as well as the the transcriptions and translations of foreign languages.


### 1.3) Movie releases

All subtitles are created for the Blu-ray releases of the extended editions and should be compatible with any releases with the same runtime lengths.

**If you want subtitles retimed for a different release, let me know** here on GitHub or in the comments of the appropriate [Reddit thread](#reddit-threads).


### 1.4) About dialogs

**All discernable foreign dialogs and monologues** in the movies are included.

Unlike in other translations, I have tried to translate the foreign languages as closely as possible. This sometimes makes the translations sound weird or simple (e.g., "Will be what will be."). However, I feel that this (correctly) shows that the foreign languages are really *foreign* languages, and thus, not everything can be translated directly into English.

I have provided the transcriptions and translations of foreign dialogs even for the dialogs which are translated and hard-coded into the movie as the oficial translations are sometimes not accurate.

For the transcription, I have mostly used the existing resources (see below). However, for some dialogs, I have found no resources on the internet and I had to transcript the dialogs using only my hearing.

*Fellowship of the Ring*: I have discerned all dialogs apart from some of the words said by the ring (e.g., after Gimli smashes the ring with an axe) and some words in the Aragorn-Haldir dialog at the edge of Lothlórien.


## 1.5) Song lyrics

Only **some selected song lyrics** are included in the subtitles.
Song lyrics are included only if they do not break the immersion and make sense.
Thus, if you hear lyrics but do not see the subtitles, keep calm as they are not so important and you are not missing anything important story-wise.
The lyrics are, thus, usually omitted if:
- someone is speaking over them,
- the song lyrics are strongly irrelevant to the scene,
- the lyrics are sung durign an action scene,
- the lyrics contain only partial words.

*Fellowship of the Ring*: I have included most of the song lyrics, but I have not included the lyrics which overlap with dialogs.

*The Two Towers*: I have not included most of the song lyrics yet. For now, I have included only the lyrics of the funeral song sung by Éowyn. I future, I plan to add more lyrics, but I am not sure when.

*Return of the King*: I have not included most of the song lyrics yet. For now, I have included only the lyrics of the coronation song sung by Aragorn. I future, I plan to add more lyrics, but I am not sure when.


## 1.6) Resources

My main sources for the transcriptions and translations were:
- Existing subtitles with some non-english dialogs:
  - Funksw's subtitles,
  - LeithioiPhilinn's subtitles,
- [Gwaith-i-Phethdain website](https://www.elvish.org/gwaith/),
- [AMagpiesNest website](https://web.archive.org/web/20200224164910/http://www.amagpiesnest.com/main.htm).


## 1.7) Current subtitle status

The subtitles for FotR are 99 % complete. I might revise some minor details in the future, but otherwise they contain everything I want to contain in them.

The subtitles for TTT are somewhat complete. All dialogs are (should be) completed, but I want to add more song lyrics when I have time.

#### 1.7.3) Return of the King

The subtitles for RotK are somewhat complete. All dialogs are (should be) completed, but I want to add more song lyrics when I have time.



## 2) Reddit threads
For each of the subtitles for each of the movie, there is a reddit thread where you can ask for additional info, request retiming to different release, or just show for love:
- [Fellowship of the Ring](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/183m2v2/complete_english_and_elvish_subtitles_for/),

## 3) Useful tools for your own modifications

If you want to **merge** my foreign-only subtitles with your own English/other subtitles, I recommend the [subtitletools/Merge Subtitles](https://subtitletools.com/merge-subtitles-online) tool.

If you want to **retime** my subtitles, I recommend the [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) tool.






## 4) Why this project?

I wanted to watch LotR and understand all that is said and sung, but I have not found any complete subtitles. So I have created them myself, and I share them with you so you can enjoy them too :) If you find any mistakes please let me know and I will edit the subtitles.
